Celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sofia Vergara</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Khloé Kardashian</a> have already <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>posted pictures in chic one-piece swimsuits</a> this year, so if you haven't found one that's right for you this season, we're here to help.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested one-piece swimsuits in pools, oceans, and showers, and we took note of the fit, comfort, quality, performance, and value. We also gathered editor-loved favorites, scoured the internet for new styles from reliable brands, and spoke with Joanna Lovering, NYC personal stylist and empowerment coach, who helped us match one-piece swimsuit styles with various body types. She encourages folks to embrace their body (no matter the shape), and she offered suggestions based on her clients' feedback regarding confidence and comfort in a one-piece bathing suit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best one-piece swimsuits for all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mindy-x-andie-the-amalfi-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mindy x Andie The Amalfi</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Andie The Amalfi One Piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6PAgz5m7hwC7G7x37rYlC0I60cE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Andie-The-Amalfi-One-Piece-5de0115f4c31450aba14d48dc6901799.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mindy Kaling recently launched a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">swimwear collaboration with Andie</a>, and when asked about her favorite piece during an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>exclusive interview with PEOPLE</a>, she specifically called out The Amalfi suit, stating, “There is a daffodil-colored one-piece — and I know that not everyone feels comfortable wearing a yellow bathing suit — but it is the most flattering cut.” This bathing suit has adjustable straps, underbust elastic, and sculpting fabric to help you feel your best when poolside, and if yellow isn’t your color, there are 13 other options to choose from, as well as two lengths and three fabric finishes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is it Kaling’s favorite one-piece, but it’s also our PEOPLE Tested top pick for a one-piece swimsuit. We tested The Amalfi swimsuit in the real world in pools and at a waterpark, and our tester loved its secure, comfortable fit that stayed in place while going down slides and playing water sports with her kids.

First, the fabric is incredibly soft and stretchy, so it was comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Second, it dried in under 10 minutes after a swim in the ocean (with no salty residue to speak of), so our tester was able to move from the ocean to her next activity in comfort. And third, it's reasonable price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did find that the top of the suit didn't offer a lot of support around the bust area and the bottom of the suit can feel cheeky, so if you're looking for a modest cut, you may need to opt for another suit. Also, note that this one-piece is final sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, elastane | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash in cold water.

This one-piece delivers the trendy one-shoulder silhouette with long-lasting materials and full coverage. Plus, the unique cut-out back is one of our favorite details. The diagonal seaming looks great on any body shape and is supportive. And it comes in a whopping 15 colorways to choose from. When we tested this swimsuit, we loved that despite being a one-shoulder style, it felt secure and didn't limit our mobility in any way. However, it doesn't come with padding, and if you're in between sizes, we recommend sizing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>0-24&nbsp;| <strong>Materials: </strong>Recycled Polyamide, elastane<strong>&nbsp;</strong>| <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash cold with gentle soap.

The spandex offers support and the ruching offers even more coverage.

Look for materials that compress and stretch (like nylon and spandex). You want your suit to stay in place, whether you’re exercising in the pool, playing water games with the family, or lounging on the beach. Always check the brand’s specific sizing guide, and if you are between sizes, look for suits with adjustable straps or other features for a more customized fit. When in doubt, size up. Some suits come in various lengths for long torsos, so we promise a well-fitted swimsuit is possible.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Activity or Purpose</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for your one-piece, think about what purpose it’ll serve.
