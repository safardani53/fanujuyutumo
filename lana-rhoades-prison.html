Indeed, the former adult star used to run with a group of criminals who robbed houses and perpetrated other offenses.</p><p>"I was just with people who were doing stuff. Basically, I had a boyfriend and he had friends — shady people. They were older than me. They break in houses, they do all that type of stuff and I was just with them," she explained during the appearance, maintaining that she never personally stole anything from anyone's house.</p><p>Lana previously admitted to Logan Paul during his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a> that she was incarcerated at 16 years old and spent over a year in prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While many would likely look back at that harsh sentence with contempt, the star reflects on it fondly. Lana even said during her appearance on Call Her Daddy, "Going to prison was probably the best thing that ever happened to me because I was on such a bad path in my life."</p><p>Beyond that, she also admitted to being arrested 20 times prior to that prison stint and having a problem with "hardcore drugs."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I never really did drugs again after I got out. I barely drink, never committed a crime after. I think I wouldn’t be where I am today if I wouldn’t have went [sic]," she said, adding, "It saved me."</p><p>Lana's then-boyfriend, who was also arrested, didn't even speak to her once while she was in prison. When she was finally released, she "started putting men in their place."</p><p>"I was the biggest [expletive] doormat before that," she added. But after that, she vowed to never let a man dictate her life again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6vrYyrn6iZlJrAbrzRoqqopg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flana-rhoades-prison.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./strictly-layton-williams-teaching-dance-classes-fix-experience.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./strictly-layton-williams-teaching-dance-classes-fix-experience.html>Layton Williams reveals he's TEACHING dance classes after Strictly fix row over previous experience</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gene-park-9gqh-html.html>Gene Park (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gene-park-9gqh-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
