But people are afraid to talk about him because of the <a href=# rel=follow>cease and desist letters</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It started at the beginning of February 2022, when most of his close friends and followers unfollowed him. They did not reveal why they chose to unfollow, but said it was serious. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Initially, people thought it was a PR stunt from Holder's side to promote his new single.</p><p>But after Holder's friends and acquaintances assured it was not a PR stunt, but rather something sinister, people started getting curious.</p><h2>Tayler Holder and Sexual Assault Allegations&nbsp;</h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Holder went to the BFFs with Dave Portnoy and Josh Richards podcast&nbsp;to discuss the controversy on February 1, 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Holder's PR team set the interview, but the TikToker said he would handle things offline.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tayler Holder taking a selfie.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That was when Portnoy asked if the mass unfollow was because of the&nbsp;sexual assault allegations. Holder did not address it properly and did not deny it either.</p><p>A day or two later, Holder once again made headlines for sending cease and desist letters to over 50 influencers.</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Keemstar</a>, the host of DramaAlert, confirmed that sexual assault and misconduct allegations were true. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also said that there were accusations of rape, and minors were also involved in the scandal. However, Keemstar did not name the source of his information.</p><p>However, it seems like the sexual assault allegations are true after all. Many influencers who got the cease and desist letters are now afraid to talk about Holder.</p><p>But <a href=# rel=follow>Bryce Hall</a> is not one of them. He is one of the receivers, but it has not stopped him from exposing Holder and talking about his drama. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Trusted Source tells <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#DramaAlert</a> Tayler Holder will be facing serious allegations from multiple Alleged victims. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#DramaAlert</a> is still working to gather all the details. Normally would not even tweet this much at this stage. But Taylor confirmed allegations were made on BFFs. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/i6Z7WlcfBb</a> — KEEM ðŸ¿ (@KEEMSTAR) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">February 2, 2022</a></p><h2>Bryce Hall Exposed Tayler Holder</h2><p>On February 7, 2021, Hall went to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first live episode</a> of the BFFs podcast. He talked about many things, out of which the most prominent was the Holder situation.&nbsp;</p><p>He clarified that the sexual assault and misconduct allegations were true, but they were hidden from the internet.</p><p>However, Portnoy mentioning those accusations in the&nbsp;interview with Holder brought it online.</p><p>Hall also noted that Holder getting unfollowed was not a PR stunt, and cease and desist letters were unnecessary. He said so because nobody was talking about Holder and his activities.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hall said, "there is a physical reason why people stopped associating with him whether it is true or not." Similarly, even if things are not out in the open at the moment, they "will come out eventually."</p><p>Regardless, Hall confirmed it was the allegations that made people unfollow him. The BFFs hosts and Hall agreed that Holder's interview from&nbsp;February 1, 2022, made the latter look "guilty" and "so bad."</p><p>This is not the first time Hall exposed Holder. Before going on the BFFs podcast, he did a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Q/A video</a> on his YouTube channel titled 'the truth about everything.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>About five minutes into the video, Hall answered what was going on with Holder, asked by one of his followers.</p><p>He said the cease and desist letter would not allow him to talk much about the drama.</p><p>But confirmed that there were "allegations going around revolving Tayler." He said that was why he did not want to associate with Holder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also pointed out that he was not close with Holder and had not talked since their infamous boxing match. But regardless of it all, he "1000%" does not want to be linked with Holder.</p><p>To date, it is not clear what the sexual assault allegations are and why exactly the cease and desist letters were sent.</p><p>Therefore, it seems like we need to wait a little more to know what is going on.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqirrCmeceao6Vlla29sL%2FEnWStmamhsrN5x6ijnZ2iYq6tuMSgmK2hn6PAb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./devonta-smith-parents-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./devonta-smith-parents-html.html>DeVonta Smiths Parents Instilled Hard Work and Humility in Him</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amelia-jackson-gray.html>Amelia Jackson-Gray Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amelia-jackson-gray.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
