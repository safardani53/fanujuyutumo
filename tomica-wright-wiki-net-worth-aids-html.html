After his death, a lot of responsibilities struck upon her. She managed everything from running the company and raising a family by herself. Amidst all the difficulties, she stood firm and proved herself to be a boss lady! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The following wiki&nbsp;covers Wright's birthday, husband's death, children,&nbsp;and&nbsp;net worth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Wright's Short Wiki Bio</h2><p>Wright was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a>&nbsp;as Tomica Woods in 1969 in&nbsp;Los Angeles, California. She celebrates her birthday every year on the 7th of December. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">grew</a>&nbsp;up with her separated parents. Due to this,&nbsp;she lived with her mother in one town, then with her father in another, and sometimes in a foster home.</p><p>She completed her high school education at San Fernando Valley.&nbsp;After pursuing a high school education, she went to&nbsp;Santa Monica College and later enrolled&nbsp;at&nbsp;West Los Angeles College. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>She Married at the Age of 26</h2><p>Wright&nbsp;first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">crossed</a> paths with the American&nbsp;rapper, Eric Lynn Wright (Eazy-E) at a&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;nightclub in 1991. After a brief friendship, they started dating. At the time,&nbsp;Eazy-E already <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had</a>&nbsp;five children from his five different relationships.</p><p>However, his multiple past relationships didn't hinder the impression for Wright. She went on to dating him. Not only that, she even gave birth to her son,&nbsp;<span>Dominick Wright, now&nbsp;</span>known as Lil Eazy, in 1994. Also, she got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pregnant</a>&nbsp;with their daughter,&nbsp;<span>Daijah Wright.</span></p><p><span>Amid the pregnancy, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;the famous rapper at the age of 26. They had dated for four years before tying the knots on March 14, 1995.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Husband Died of Aids-Related Complications</h2><p>The businesswoman tied the wedding knots with Eazy-E when&nbsp;he was still <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a>&nbsp;to the hospital due to health complications. A month before the wedding, in&nbsp;late February, her partner was diagnosed with AIDS after being admitted to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a violent cough. His health condition only deteriorated from there.</p><p>But despite the health issues, Wright and Eazy-E <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">officiated</a>&nbsp;their&nbsp;marriage, that too, in the intensive care unit. Twelve days after their wedding, her husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">succumbed</a>&nbsp;to pneumonia induced by AIDs&nbsp;on March 26, 1995.</p><p></p><p><strong>Back Then: Tomica in a vintage picture with her then-husband,&nbsp;Eazy-E, in the 1990s. </strong>(Photo: Prettystatus.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Wright's partner was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buried</a>&nbsp;in a gold casket at Rose Hills Memorial Park on April 7, 1995. Six months after the death, she gave <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birth</a>&nbsp;to her daughter,&nbsp;<span>Daijah Wright.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her stepdaughter,&nbsp;E.B.

Her&nbsp;smart business strategies accelerated the distribution deals of the company within two years.</p><p>Being the company's CEO, Wright even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a>&nbsp;a lawsuit against her stepson,&nbsp;Eric Darnell,&nbsp;a musician, and HIV activist, in August 2017.
