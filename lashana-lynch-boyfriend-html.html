<time>25 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>British actress Lashana Lynch, who played Brie Larson's best friend in the movie Captain Marvel in 2019, has not publicly disclosed her sexual orientation or relationship status. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As netizens watched the Marvel movie, some speculated that Brie's character, Carol, may have had romantic feelings towards Tessa Thompson's character, Valkyrie, since he had no male love interest in the movie.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As the movie's popularity grew, many also began to bring forth gay rumors when conversing about Lashana's sexuality and relationship status. They also wondered if she was dating, married or single.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This article explores Lashana Lynch's sexuality and relationship status, from boyfriend and husband rumors to gay rumors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Lashana Lynch a lesbian?</h2><p>As of writing, Lashana Lynch, born&nbsp;on&nbsp;November 27, 1987,&nbsp;in Hammersmith, London, England, to her Jamaican immigrant parents,&nbsp;has not publicly revealed her sexuality on her social media. But what's known is her character "Miss Honey" from Matilda the Musical (2022) has long been admired by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LGBTIQ+ community</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, the talented actress only found out about it after discovering supportive comments on social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Oh my gosh, this is a revelation to me,' she shared her thoughts on the matter with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">EW</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also revealed to the magazine that one of her queer fans regarded Miss Honey (and the actress&nbsp;Embeth Davidtz) as their gay icon growing up. The friend was referring to the 1996 movie Matilda, the first adaptation of the 1988 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Lynch then insisted in the interview that a perfect character is that who "represents everything to you and can speak to all people, all races, all sexes, all walks of life." She added: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"You don't have to do anything else apart from just being, and every community is going to get what they need from this one person. That's really special. That's a secret weapon. If you can have a character like that in every film or every play or every book that everyone from every walk of life can take something from."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Back in 2021, the London native had yet again excited the community by portraying the role of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> lesbian black agent Nomi, 007, in James Bond series movie No Time To Die</a>. Her character in the film was replacing the famous James bond after his retirement.</p><h2>Does Lashana Lynch have a boyfriend or husband?</h2><p>Lashana Lynch is very private and has kept her personal life out of the spotlight.</p><p>Many fans and followers wondered about her love life when she came to fame because of Captain Marvel and No Time to Die. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They have&nbsp;asked questions like, "is Lashana Lynch married?" and "Does she have a boyfriend or a partner?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Lynch has never answered those questions herself. Therefore, whether she has a partner, boyfriend, or even a husband remains unconfirmed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Similarly, there has also been no news of her being married yet, and she has never been discovered engaging in PDA with any person as of writing.</p><p>However, we only glimpse the actress's life via her Instagram. There, she has numerous pictures with&nbsp;Damola Adelaja.</p><p>This has led many to believe that Adelaja is Lynch's boyfriend and that the pair are in a relationship.</p><h2>Is Damola Adelaja Lashana Lynch's boyfriend?</h2><p>As said before, Lynch has never revealed if she has a partner. In addition, she has never addressed the topic of dating and having a boyfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Therefore, it cannot be said for sure that Adelaja is Lynch's partner. However, many tabloids have reported that the pair have been together for a long time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Lashana Lynch with her rumored partner, Damila Adelaja.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>For instance, <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Hollywood Magazine</a> confirmed the couple has been dating for quite some time.&nbsp;Lynch and Adelaja's love for one other has been open and ambiguous on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lynch has around a dozen pictures of Adelaja on her Instagram, where the first one dates back to May 4, 2012. The Captain Marvel star has gushed about how much she appreciated her "boy" in one post.</p><p>She again&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted a picture</a> of the two looking adoringly at each other. In the captions, she wrote how Adelaja had been with her "through thick & thin, flaws & all."</p><p>She appreciated Adelaja for showing her how to be a better human being&nbsp;and said she was still learning to become one. She dubbed her "D" and said everyone needed a person like him in their life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She ended her caption with hashtags&nbsp;" #friendsforlife #love #vip #cherishthespecialones."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another post</a> dated June 24, 2015, the actress wrote how much she loved her rumored boyfriend.</p><p>She thanked him for being there for her and supporting her no matter what. She appreciated him being his "truth teller," and a "kick up the backside when I need it." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Once again, she ended her captions with the hashtags "#love #bestie." All in all, it seems like Lynch and Adelaja enjoy and love having each other in their lives.</p><p>The last picture Lynch posted&nbsp;about Adelaja was on September 14, 2019. After that, she remained silent about her friendship or relationship with Adelaja.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Who Is Lashana Lynch's rumored boyfriend, Adelaja?</h2><p>Adelaja, nicknamed D-Boy, is a British actor of Nigerian origin who studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He directs and produces films in addition to acting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>D-Boy made his cinematic debut in 2013 with Fela / Sidy,&nbsp;which won Best Short Film at the 23rd African, Asian, and Latin American Film Festival in Milan.</p><p>He is also well-known for acting in&nbsp;the controversial 2006 film Rag Tag, about two childhood friends who fall in love. It was contentious since the main characters were gay, yet both actors are straight guys in real life.</p><h2>Recent News</h2><p>In August 2022, it was announced that Lynch would play <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Bob Marley's wife, Rita</a>,&nbsp;in the upcoming Paramount biopic about the world-famous singer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSRqLWiusBmo7Kmk516o7vYn6minZ6Ze6nAzKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flashana-lynch-boyfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./unai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./unai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html>Unai Emery Labeled His Ex-Girlfriend A White Witch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./william-esrey.html>Fame | William Esrey net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./william-esrey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
