Kind and giving beyond measure,” she shared.</p><p>“She made everyone she met feel uniquely special, and no one ever went away from her without a hug.”</p><p>She said that Bonnie had loved living and working at her bed and breakfast in Utah for the past few years</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“She was always the kind of person who would welcome people into her home with open arms and a giving heart, making them feel at home, and she continued that at the b&b,” she wrote.</p><p>“I only hope to carry that spirit with me as I continue with future plans for the b&b, making everyone who enters feel welcome, loved, special, and worthy, just like my mom would have done.”</p><p>It was a lovely tribute, but her followers had some things to get off their chests about how things had played out.</p><p>“That was a very hard episode to watch,” one person told her. “You should not have been alone at that time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Broke my heart watching you all alone!!!!” another comment read. “I cried and cried … I hope you find someone so you know what it really feels like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to have that from a partner</a>.”</p><p>One person said “I better not hear one more word of criticism for how she has treated ANYONE in that family again after witnessing this episode.”</p><p>“There is no way Meri wouldn’t have been there for any of her sister wives in the same situation. The only reason she didn’t got to Janelle’s mom’s funeral was because Kody went and asked her not to.”</p><p>Yet another comment read “I was disappointed that you had to drive all alone. Such a big family yet alone in that difficult time. I felt your pain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The comments go on and on like this, with Meri’s followers telling her over and over that she shouldn’t have been alone.</p><p>And they all have good points — Meri had always been following Kody’s strict COVID rules, so it’s strange that he didn’t go with her.</p><p>Robyn had been following the rules as well, as had her older children, so one of them could have gone along for support.</p><p>Even though Meri has been trying so hard for so long to get on Kody’s good side, this could have been a moment to put that aside and let Christine or Janelle help her out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But instead, she had to get a phone call in the car by herself that her mother had died, and that’s just truly awful.</p><p>We would say that hopefully Kody saw this episode and realized that he seriously dropped the ball here, but that would require him having a level of self-awareness that he’s shown time and time again that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he simply does not have</a>.</p><p>As it is, we can just hope that Meri feels at peace with how things happened.</p><ul
