<time>07 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Every Olympic</strong> fan wants to know who Emily Seebohm is. Please stay with us till we find out. Swimming champion Emily Jane Seebohm OAM came to prominence after competing in the Olympics. Between 2008 and 2021, she appeared in four games.</p><p>Similarly, the Australian swimmer has three Olympic gold medals, seven Commonwealth Games gold medals, and five world championship gold medals. She is also trained by Michael Bohi and is a member of the institution Energy Standard Griffith University. In addition, the Australian swimmer is capable of performing a variety of strokes, including freestyle, medley, butterfly, and backstroke. In addition to backstroke, the backstroke specialist has medaled in individual medley and freestyle. Let us now go further to understand more about her parents, family, and siblings.</p><h2>Emily Seebohm Parents: Father John Seebohm and Mother Karen Seebohm</h2><p><strong>Emily Seebohm</strong> is a swimming champion, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, in June 1992. The 6-foot-1,83-meter-tall Australian swimmer was escorted to her parents, John and Karen Seebohm. Emily’s parents enrolled her at St Joseph’s Catholic Primary School till 7th grade, after which she transferred to St John Fisher College. The college is a girls-only catholic institution. Seebohm’s father, John, was a former SANFL player. The Glenelg Tigers pro footballer appeared in at least 300 games.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Emily-Seebohm-1.jpg alt="Emily Seebohm" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When it comes to Emily’s mother, Karen is a swimming instructor and the first of her daughters. When Emily won gold medals in all of her games and competitions, the mother-daughter team must have been overjoyed. Emily obviously spent most of her youth learning in the pool. Karen, her mother, has a different opinion about her daughter. Karen’s kid will always be remembered as the charming, cheeky child who enjoyed defeating her older brothers in bicycle races. A lovely tidbit about Emily when she was younger. Karen stated:</p><p>Previously, she (referring to Emily) was simply the youngster that raced around screaming at the pool. We (Karen and John) finally realized how terrific a swimmer we had on our hands when she was 12 years old.&nbsp;Emily traveled to the United States for Olympic Games training after seven years, when she was 19 years old.</p><h2>Emily Seebohm’s Parents and Siblings</h2><p>Emily Seebohm, an excellent Australian swimmer, has a lovely family of five individuals. When it came to her family, she lived with her father, mother, and two older siblings.&nbsp;She liked to play and battle with her two older brothers, as previously said. Emily used to get all of her family’s attention since she was the youngest.&nbsp;Similarly, she dropped out of middle school due to her parents’ intention to pursue a professional swimming career.</p><p>When it comes to Emily’s romantic life, she was formerly involved with a fellow swimmer, Mitch Larkin. They started dating in 2015. In addition, the former couple had a home in Hendra, Brisbane. They purchased it jointly. Unfortunately, things did not proceed as planned, and the two exceptional swimmers called it quits in July 2018.&nbsp;The Emily Seebohm Aquatic Centre is named after Seebohm and is located in Bracken Ridge.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Emily-Seebohm-2.jpg alt="Emily Seebohm" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On January 26, 2009, she was also granted Australia’s highest accolade, the Medal of the Order of Australia.&nbsp;She rose to prominence in 2022 after starring in reality series such as I’m a Celebrity: Get Me Out of Here! and The Challenge: Australia. The great Australian swimmer seems to have more to give in the coming days.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2Bmecmon6dlo5qyo7vHpmSappRiuKK%2BxKdkrJ2Vl7ypuYymnJ6sXZq6qrjYZqqenZKkta55z5qpnqakqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-john-seebohm-and-karen-seebohm-meet-emily-seebohm-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-wide-neck-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-wide-neck-dating.html>Who is Wide Neck Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-all-purpose-flour.html>What is all-purpose flour? | The Sun</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-all-purpose-flour.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
