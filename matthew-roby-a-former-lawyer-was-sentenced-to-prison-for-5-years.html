He allegedly stole millions from an elderly lady named Helen Kuhn, according to detectives.&nbsp;Roby obtained power of attorney over Kuhn via deception, according to investigators, and siphoned $3 million from her accounts. According to the Orange County Sheriff‚Äôs Office:</p><p>‚ÄúRoby agreed to a plea agreement today that would place him in jail for 5 years for Elder Abuse and Grand Theft of more than $100,000.‚Äù</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Was anyone else looking after her? This is horrible.</p><p>‚Äî ‚òïeddie of The Shire üêâ (@VentiMochaLite) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2022</a></p><p>Matthew Roby was arrested in 2021 and later disbarred. In Florida, he is no longer permitted to practice law. According to accounts, Kuhn, who died earlier this month at the age of 108, became aware of Roby‚Äôs deception years ago.&nbsp;Kuhn was suspected after receiving a high tax bill in 2019. When she approached Roby about it, he told her she had to pay for it. When Kuhn became suspicious, she went to the sheriff‚Äôs office.&nbsp;After many years of research, it was discovered that Matthew Roby had somehow obtained her power of attorney. The accused moved her money to another bank and even spent part of it.</p><h2>Matthew Roby, a disgraced attorney, must pay for his misdeeds</h2><p>On June 24, the Orange County Sheriff‚Äôs Office stated that Winter Park lawyer Matthew Roby, who represented the now-deceased Helen Kuhn, will be imprisoned for five years.&nbsp;Interestingly, before his son, Roby‚Äôs father was also Kuhn‚Äôs attorney. Ronald Roby was also expelled from the bar in 2014 for theft of money. Ronald allegedly stole tens of thousands of dollars from one of his customers‚Äô accounts.</p><h2>Matthew Roby‚Äôs fraud victim Helen Kuhn</h2><p>Helen Kuhn was well-known for her outgoing demeanor. She married for the first time at the age of 60, then received her pilot‚Äôs license and drove until she was 101.</p><p>Orange County authorities said about her:</p><p>‚ÄúHelen taught for 35 years, flew aircraft until she was 93, and drove until she was 101.‚Äù</p><p>Kuhn‚Äôs close buddy also said that she was skilled with money. According to Karen Murillo, an advocacy manager for AARP Florida, one out of every ten Americans is a victim of ‚Äúsome type of elder abuse.‚Äù&nbsp;Murillo further said that incidents of attorney exploitation had increased in recent years. Speaking about the subject, she stated:</p><p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, this is not the first instance of an attorney being used. I‚Äôll tell you that exploitation happens because of a person‚Äôs closeness to an elderly or vulnerable adult.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Matthew-Roby-2-1.jpg alt="Matthew Roby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, exploitation is on the increase. What we‚Äôre witnessing is that it‚Äôs becoming worse throughout the country, with victims of exploitation losing an average of $120,000 every year.‚Äù</p><p>According to Economic Crimes Detective Chris Williams, deputies were able to retrieve more than $2.4 million taken from Kuhn.&nbsp;Officials believe there might be more casualties.
