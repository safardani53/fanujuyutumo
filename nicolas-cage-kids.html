This led many to wonder whether he was already a father, and who his other children were.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Nicolas Cage have any kids?</h2><p>Even prior to the announcement of Riko's pregnancy, Nicolas was already a father of two. His first son, Weston Cage Coppola, was born in 1990 and was the result of his short-lived engagement with actress Christina Fulton. Weston is currently working as an actor and producer. He has appeared on the soundtrack of films like Joe and also acted alongside his father in Lord of War. Weston has also been married three times and has four children.</p><p>Nicolas's second child is Kal-El Coppola, who was born in 2005 and was the only child he and his third wife Alice Kim shared. Nicolas and Alice were married from 2004 to 2016, and she gave birth to Kal-El in October of 2005. Kal-El is a reference to the Kryptonian name of Superman, a comic book character that Nicolas is obsessed with and was once on the verge of playing.</p><p>Although he is younger than Weston, Kal-El did have a voice role in Teen Titans Go! to the Movies.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicolas Cage is going to be a father again.</h2><p>In January 2022, news broke that Nicolas was preparing to be a father once again. Nearly three months later, the Face/Off actor appeared on an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show and revealed that he and his wife Riko are expecting a baby girl.</p><p>"I'm gonna announce some big news for everybody — I'm gonna have a little girl," Nic said, grinning from ear to ear. He also explained that he and Riko have decided on their daughter's name: Lennon Augie.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The inspiration behind their little girl's name comes from Nic's "favorite song ever written" — The Beatles' "Across the Universe" off their last studio album "Let It Be"— and his father's name, August Coppola. OK, that's the sweetest thing ever!</p><p>For those unaware, Nicolas and Riko were introduced by mutual friends in Japan and got married in <a href=#>February of 2021</a>.</p><p>"I thought [Riko] was stunning when I met her. We had a lot in common," Nicolas explained during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> on the red carpet for Pig in July 2021.</p><p>"She likes animals, too, so I asked her, 'Do you have any pets?' And she said, 'Yes, I have flying squirrels,'" the actor continued. "She had two sugar gliders. ... I thought, 'That’s it. This could work out.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicolas Cage has been married five times.</h2><p>After his engagement to Christina ended without a marriage, Nicolas was married to actress Patricia Arquette from 1995 to 2002, with that marriage ending in divorce. Later in 2002, he was married to Lisa Marie Presley for 107 days, with that marriage also ending in divorce.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nicolas Cage's wife is HOW OLD?!?!?!??!?!?! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0TGb9joMVy</a></p>— Knicks Memes (@KnicksMemes) <a href=#>April 22, 2022</a></figure><p>He was then married to Alice for over a decade, and then married Erika Koike in Las Vegas in 2019, but that marriage ended in a divorce after only four days.</p><p>Nicolas has faced some criticism for the <a href=#>age gap</a> between himself and Riko. The actor is currently 58, and Riko is just 27. Even so, Riko is one of his longest-lasting marriages to date, and now he's prepared to become a father for the third time with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aku8uaqmabkZyybrfInao%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnicolas-cage-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sam-holmes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sam-holmes.html>Sam Holmes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jimmy-bell-passed-away-at-the-age-of-69.html>Jimmy Bell Passed Away At The Age Of 69</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jimmy-bell-passed-away-at-the-age-of-69.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
