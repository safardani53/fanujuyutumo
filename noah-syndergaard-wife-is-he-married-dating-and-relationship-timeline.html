<time>29 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Noah Syndergaard’s wife has become a topic of intense speculation following the engagement announcement of Alex Cooper to film producer Matt Kaplan, marking a new chapter in her love life.</strong></p><p>Noah Seth Syndergaard, also known as “Thor,” is an <a href=#>American professional baseball pitcher</a>.</p><p>He plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Major League Baseball (MLB). Syndergaard’s baseball journey flourished during his senior year at Mansfield Legacy High School in 2010.</p><p>A growth spurt and dedicated weight training routine significantly improved his pitch velocity, catching the attention of scouts.</p><p>Despite being overlooked by scouts and college coaches, he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays after being selected in the first round of the 2010 MLB Draft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-1-53-e1685266364705.jpg><p>Syndergaard was later traded to the New York Mets, where he made his MLB debut in 2015.</p><p>He played a crucial role in the Mets’ journey to the 2015 World Series, pitching in their only win of the series.</p><p>Syndergaard has faced injury setbacks throughout his career, including Tommy John surgery in 2020.</p><p>In 2022, he signed with the Los Angeles Angels before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and then signing with the Dodgers for the 2023 season.</p><h2>Noah Syndergaard Wife: Is He Married? Dating And Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Noah Syndergaard has been making headlines not only for his athletic achievements but also for his relationship and dating life.</p><p>Syndergaard was involved in an on-and-off relationship with Alex Cooper, the host of “<strong>Call Her Daddy</strong>,” throughout 2017.</p><p>Their public appearances as a couple ended at a Knicks basketball game in December of that year.</p><p>Syndergaard confirmed their breakup through a tweet proclaiming baseball as his significant other.</p><p>Cooper, known as “Slim Shady” on her podcast, openly discussed her relationship with Syndergaard. She even revealed they started dating during her senior year at Boston University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-134-e1685266305691.jpg><p>Alex also credited Noah for helping her secure a job at Gotham magazine. It was a significant stepping stone for her career.</p><p>However, their relationship faced internal turbulence, as revealed by Cooper on an episode of her podcast in February 2021.</p><p>Cooper recently got engaged to film producer Matt Kaplan, as she shared in an interview with W magazine in April 2023. She even posted her cute moments on her social media.</p><p>The engagement marks a new chapter in Cooper’s love life while Syndergaard navigates his single status.</p><h2>Noah Syndergaard’s Struggles Continue with Dodgers</h2><p>Noah Syndergaard, a starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, has been struggling this season.</p><p>He has a 6.12 ERA and a 1-3 record in seven starts.</p><p>Despite his struggles, there is a chance that Syndergaard will make his next start on Monday against the Minnesota Twins if his bullpen session goes well on Saturday.</p><p>However, fantasy managers may not be enthusiastic about having him in their lineups, given his performance this season.</p><p>During a recent game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Syndergaard allowed another six runs, causing his ERA to climb to 6.27.</p><p>This places him among the pitchers with the highest ERAs in the league for those with 50 innings or more.</p><p>The Dodgers had signed Syndergaard with the expectation that he could regain his dominant form and reclaim his 100mph fastball. Unfortunately, he has yet to achieve that goal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-2-44-e1685268174218.jpg><p>Syndergaard expressed his frustration, stating that he feels like his last weapons have been taken away from him.</p><p>He acknowledged that his current repertoire is insufficient to compete against opposing teams effectively.</p><p>The Dodgers manager, Dave Roberts, recognized Syndergaard’s desire to regain his fastball velocity but also emphasized the importance of command.</p><p>While there have been discussions about potentially giving up on Syndergaard and moving on from the $13 million investment, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dodgers</a> currently lack a clear replacement option.</p><p>The team is thin on pitching staff due to injuries, making it challenging to find immediate alternatives.</p><p>However, with prospects performing well at the Double-A level, the Dodgers may consider calling them up if needed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC6zpqfZqupo7GmvsaamKucXay2p7GMoqpmoJViuqK%2B0aKcnWWUlsGqusZmmKecXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW7AyKacpaGemnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnoah-syndergaard-wife-is-he-married-dating-and-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ray-boudreaux-use-me-the-voice-blind-audition.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ray-boudreaux-use-me-the-voice-blind-audition.html>Ray Boudreaux - Use Me (The Voice Blind Audition)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./french-bulldog-spine-issues-adoption-after-abandoned-in-box-8416433.html>French Bulldog with Spine Issues Up for Adoption After Being Abandoned</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./french-bulldog-spine-issues-adoption-after-abandoned-in-box-8416433.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
