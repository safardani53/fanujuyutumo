He amassed a billion-dollar wealth via several sources of income. Though he had previously generated short-term profits from other enterprises, it was real estate investments and projects that brought him hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><h2>Career</h2><p><strong>Jay Bloom</strong> began his entrepreneurial path with the establishment of Pet Assure Inc. According to Inc, he founded the pet firm with Carolyn Farkas. He formerly worked at Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, a bank.&nbsp;He obtained a helicopter pilot’s license and purchased his first helicopter after generating significant profits from his first firm.&nbsp;Unlike most affluent individuals, he wished to maximize its value by commercializing it. Within a year, he had acquired seven helicopters. Soon after, he purchased the flying school where he first received his pilot license.</p><p>Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration gave the school a Part 135 permit, which allows it to conduct charter flights.&nbsp;He wanted to expand the company by providing short-duration flights near a beach region with stunning ocean views. He was able to triple his earnings as a result of this.&nbsp;Following the September 11th attacks, the company did not seem to be viable. He eventually joined forces with Eastman Kodak to form another firm. He began a mafia show in Las Vegas over the following three years.</p><p>Bloom started investing in real estate after gaining money from this endeavor. He eventually began purchasing a large number of properties, developing them, and selling them for a profit. Bloom made a fortune for himself in this manner. He just went viral after posting a discussion he had with the late OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. Jay claimed in a Facebook post that the CEO asked him about diving into the Titanic crash site, but he declined due to safety concerns. Bloom was not convinced by the late CEO’s argument that it was safer than flying a helicopter. Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood eventually took over the seats.</p><h2>Jay Bloom Wife & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Jay Bloom’s wife?&nbsp;</b>The marital status of Jay Bloom is unknown. Carolyn Farkas was his wife. In truth, she is a self-employed businesswoman. However, it is unknown if the pair is still together.&nbsp;He is the father of a boy called Sean. He has dated at least two women during his life, although no information is available about them.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmrFdl7mwu8xo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjay-bloom.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./skydiving-instructor-loosened-harness-falls-to-his-death-takes-own-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./skydiving-instructor-loosened-harness-falls-to-his-death-takes-own-life.html>Skydiving Instructor Loosens His Harness, Falls to His Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./caitlin-powell-19981005-html.html>Caitlin Powell (Folk Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./caitlin-powell-19981005-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
