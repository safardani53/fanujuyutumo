He’s the third-born child of <strong>John Lee Phoenix</strong>, a&nbsp;landscape gardening company founder, and&nbsp;<strong>Arlyn “Heart” Phoenix</strong>, a former NBC secretary. John and Arlyn traveled a lot with their kids as members of the religious cult called Children of God, before settling down in Los Angeles. There, the kids all got into acting. Learn more about Joaquin and his siblings below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joaquin-Phoenix-siblings-liberty-embed.jpg><h2><strong>River Phoenix&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>River Phoenix</a>&nbsp;</strong>was Joaquin’s eldest sibling. River was born on August 23, 1970, and he started showing some acting chops at a very young age. He started off working in TV commercials at the age of 10, before his breakout role came around in the 1986 film&nbsp;Stand by Me. Two years later, River earned an Oscar nomination for his role as Donny Pope in the drama&nbsp;Running On Empty. He went on to star in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>,&nbsp;My Own Private Idaho, and&nbsp;Sneakers.&nbsp;River also had talent in music. He and one of his sisters formed a band called <strong>Aleka’s Attic</strong>, which operated out of Florida from 1987 to 1992.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Despite a blossoming career, River was facing personal struggles and started using drugs. Sadly, the actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tragically died</a> at the age of 23 on October 31, 1993 after overdosing on cocaine and heroin. He was outside the Viper Room in Los Angeles when he collapsed and died. Joaquin, one of his sisters, and River’s girlfriend, <strong>Samantha Mathis</strong>, were all there to witness the tragedy. River was due to star in Neil Jordan’s&nbsp;Interview with the Vampire at the time of his death, so the role ended up going to <strong>Christian Slater</strong>. River’s final project that made the big screen was&nbsp;Dark Blood, which was not released until 2012.</p><h2><strong>Rain Phoenix</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joaquin-Phoenix-siblings-rain-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Rain Phoenix</strong>, 48, is the second-born sibling of the family. She got into music at a young age, and when she was 15 she formed Aleka’s Attic with big brother River. She also had bits in a few TV shows, including&nbsp;Amazing Stories and&nbsp;<i>Family Ties</i>, as well as in the 1987 film&nbsp;Maid to Order. When Aleka’s Attic was on hiatus due to River’s booming film career, Rain scored a role in 1993’s&nbsp;Even Cowgirls Get The Blue&nbsp;opposite <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Uma Thurman</strong></a>. On Halloween of the year, Rain was out with both of her brothers in L.A. when River died of an overdose.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Rain was understandably devastated about the loss of River. “Of course there is a sadness with not seeing him in the physical world but everything I do, he is a part of,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2011. In the decades since, Rain has stay connected to her late brother through her music. She even released her first solo album, titled&nbsp;River, in 2019.&nbsp;Rain eventually returned to acting with roles in&nbsp;Stranger Inside and&nbsp;Hitch. She is also involved in different social initiatives with her siblings.</p><h2><strong>Liberty Phoenix</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The fourth-born and second-youngest of the Phoenix fam would be&nbsp;<strong>Liberty Phoenix</strong>, 45. Liberty followed in her older siblings’ footsteps and started acting in the 1980’s. She appeared in&nbsp;Kate’s Secret&nbsp;and then&nbsp;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. But after that, Liberty put an end to her acting career. In the late 90s she formed the band <strong>The Causey Way</strong> with both of her sisters, but it disbanded in 2001. Liberty is no longer involved in Hollywood, and instead she works as the office manager for <strong>River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding</strong>, a charity organization started by her mother. Liberty is also busy raising a family: she is married to&nbsp;<strong>Ernesto Asch</strong>,&nbsp;and together they have five kids.</p><h2><strong>Summer Phoenix</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joaquin-Phoenix-siblings-summer-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Last but not least of Joaquin’s siblings is sister <strong>Summer Phoenix</strong>, 42. Summer was also a child actor, with her initial roles being guest appearances in the TV shows <i>Airwolf</i>,&nbsp;<i>Murder, She Wrote</i>, <i>Growing Pains</i>, <i>Swamp</i> <i>Thing</i> and <i>ER</i>. Her most notable film roles include&nbsp;Girl,&nbsp;Esther Kahn,&nbsp;Suzie Gold, and&nbsp;All at Once. Summer also briefly appeared on Broadway in London for <i>This is Our Youth&nbsp;</i>in 2002.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Summer’s career in the entertainment industry led to her meeting actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Casey Affleck</strong></a>. The two got engaged on December 25, 2003, and they welcomed a son, <strong>Indiana August</strong>, on May 31, 2004. The couple tied the knot on June 3, 2006, and welcomed their second child, son <strong>Atticus</strong>, in 2008. Summer and Casey separated in November 2015, and Summer filed for divorce in August 2017, citing “irreconcilable differences.” Their divorce was finalized by the end of the year. Despite the split, Casey, 46, has always spoke highly of Summer. “Summer is and always has been an amazing mother,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> in 2019. “She’s loving and fun and the boys worship her, so I think that even in our differences, she and I have found a nice balance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8momKqtmaN6sbTOnqWisF2otqO4yKeerGVkaoN0g5dpZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoaquin-phoenix-siblings-4563780.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paul-walker-laid-to-rest-in-private-funeral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paul-walker-laid-to-rest-in-private-funeral.html>Paul Walker Laid to Rest in Private Funeral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jennifer-scott.html>Fame | Jennifer Scott net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jennifer-scott.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
