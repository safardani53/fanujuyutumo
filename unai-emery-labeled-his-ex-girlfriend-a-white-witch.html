In a restaurant, the pair were initially acquainted by mutual acquaintances. However, the marriage did not endure long and ended in divorce. Lander Emery Fernandez, the couple’s 18-year-old son, is the couple’s only child.</p><h2>His father and grandpa were goalkeepers.</h2><p>Juan, Unai’s father, and Antonio, Unai’s grandpa, were both goalkeepers. His grandfather played for Real Union in the 1920s, helping them win the Copa del Rey in 1924 and 1927.&nbsp;Growing up in a household of goalkeepers, where football was a daily subject, instilled in me a love of the game. He began playing football with his feet, which led to a career as a left-sided midfielder. Lander, one of his sons, is the other goalie on the team. His son’s first football recollection is of his granddad as a goalie.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Unai-Emery-1.jpg alt="Unai Emery" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>He referred to his ex-girlfriend as a white witch.</h2><p>Unai was in a relationship with Sacha Wright until they split up in September 2019. The pair met for the first time in the summer of 2018. Sacha said that she was unaware of his fame since she did not follow football very closely. Their frequent meeting site was the Gaucho steak restaurant in Hampstead, North West London.&nbsp;When they relocated to his gorgeous home in Barnet and he began watching games in bed, she became aware of his football fixation. Later, he gradually began blaming her for every setback at Arsenal, branding her a white witch and bringing ill luck into his life. He constantly watched games and checked results, according to her, and would lie in bed watching games with one game on the computer and the other on the tablet.</p><p>She soon became used to his conduct, but her annoyance peaked when he refused to introduce her to his friends and family and became agitated whenever anybody attempted to photograph them together. Because the relationship she believed was serious was not serious to him, she chose to end it. When Unai was fired from Arsenal, she rushed back to him, but he blamed her for his dismissal.&nbsp;According to reports, Unai was seeing another lady called Lucila Vila Segui, a bar owner in his home in Spain, and at the same time, he was dating his current girlfriend.</p><h2>What does he enjoy Outside of football?</h2><p>Unai is highly devout and looks forward to his hometown’s major festival, The Alarde de Hondarribia. Since 1639, the celebration has been held on September 8th to thank the Virgin of Guadalupe for their freedom from the siege, which they had pledged when the city was encircled by French forces on July 1st, 1638, and to remember those who died in the siege.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Unai-Emery-2.jpg alt="Unai Emery" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They had promised to go to her shrine on Olearso’s promontory if they were able to liberate themselves via her prayers. It survived for 69 days and was destroyed when 25,000 French forces bombarded the city, leaving barely 300 survivors, yet they continued to fight.&nbsp;Finally, the French forces left. He also enjoys racquet sports such as padel and chess. Aside from that, he enjoys walking and does it often.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>His yearly pay at Arsenal was believed to be £6 million, while his salary at PSG was rumored to be £4.5 million. His predicted net worth in 2023 is between £25 million and £50 million.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Football manager</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Unai Emery</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGisp5mZYrKusdGyZKWZkpq5prCMoaCsZZWteqi10aWdq6GVo7FurYywn6KslWLEqsDCoWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2funai-emery-labeled-his-ex-girlfriend-a-white-witch.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-you-the-one-couples-who-is-still-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-you-the-one-couples-who-is-still-together.html>'Are You the One?'
