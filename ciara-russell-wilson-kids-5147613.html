Ciara, 37, has been the voice of tons of hit songs and been one of the most widely-respected R&B singers of all time. Russell, 34, is one of the best quarterbacks playing in the NFL. While he’s currently on the Denver Broncos, he previously led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl victory in 2014.

She welcomed her first child Future Zahir with the “Life Is Good” rapper in May 2014. The couple’s engagement ended shortly after Future Jr. was born, and Ciara started dating Russell in 2015. It’s clear that the Denver Bronco has a great bond with Future and treats him like his own son (though the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rapper has dissed</a> Russell in some of his songs).</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just as with his younger kids, Russell regularly shares <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>birthday messages</a> with Future on his Instagram, where he gushes about how proud he is of his stepson. When the “Young King” celebrated his ninth birthday in May 2023, the QB commemorated it with a special message. “We love you. 9 represents confidence, skill & wisdom! The last of the single digits. You are a Leader, Compassionate to others, an amazing big brother, and an amazing son. But most importantly you are a Child of God,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Future has shown that he’s been inspired by both of his parents’ careers. While he has a long way to go, he could follow in his stepdad’s footsteps to the NFL or his mom to a musical career. Russell has posted tons of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>videos</a> of his stepson undergoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>football training,</a> showing off his skills, but Future has also been featured on some of his mom’s songs. His laugh was first featured on his mom’s 2015 song<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “I Got You.”&nbsp;</a> He also made a guest appearance on his mama’s 2022 song “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Treat</a>.” Ciara admitted that he “loves music and sports” in a 2022 interview with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;She Knows.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Sienna Princess Wilson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ciara-family-russell-wilson-kids-sienna-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Russell and Ciara welcomed their first child together in April 2017. Ciara gave birth to&nbsp;<strong>Sienna Princess,&nbsp;</strong>6, a year after they got married. Like her brother, she also made an appearance on “Treat,” and Ciara admitted that music is one of Sienna’s biggest passions. “Sienna loves music. I think she’s going to run the world one day. She is 5 going on 21 for sure,” she told&nbsp;She Knows.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Both Sienna and her older brother have also made appearances alongside their mom for various campaigns, like when they were all featured in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gap ad</a> in matching outfits in August 2023. Ciara has revealed that her daughter has a fondness for Barbies and gymnastics in a July 2022 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Russell revealed</a> that he took Sienna to their first <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daddy-daughter dance</a> back in March 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Like his other children, Russell pens emotional <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tributes</a> to Sienna on each birthday. When<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> she celebrated her sixth</a> birthday, he gushed about how wonderful his daughter is. “You are the sweetest, smartest, kindest, and the funniest little girl in the world. You are just like your Momma! I never knew Jesus would bless me with 2 miracles to love and take care of His perfect gifts,” he wrote. “6 Years of just overflow and gratitude. I love you for the joy you bring Sienna.”</p><h2>Win Harrison Wilson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ciara-family-russell-wilson-kids-win-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Ciara gave birth to the pair’s youngest son&nbsp;<strong>Win Harrison,&nbsp;</strong>3, in July 2020. The “Body Party” singer revealed that her youngest son’s name was her husband’s choice. “Russell would always be like, ‘Here’s Win shortstop,’ he like, plays a whole thing out. And then obviously, Harrison, it was his dad’s first name, which is really sweet and precious,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Russell shared more details about Win’s name in his third birthday <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. “Your name represents “Victory over every challenge!” Through Christ, ALL things are possible! Keep being the light in every room! Your Mom & I love you so much as well as Future & Sienna bc you bring Joy, Love, Peace & Fun every day to our home! Love you to Heaven & Back,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>As the youngest, Win is still growing and looking up to his older siblings. The popstar opened up about her youngest son growing up fast in a March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “They say the third baby kind of moves or learns the quickest because they’re trying to keep up with their siblings, and he’s on it,” she said. “He’s talking really early, he’s moving, he’s a big baby and he’s really tall, you know?”</p><h2>New Baby</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ciara</a> announced that she was pregnant with her fourth child and third with Russell in an Instagram video on Tuesday, August 8, 2023. She showed off her baby bump as she danced poolside in a video set to her collaboration with&nbsp;<strong>Chris Brown&nbsp;</strong>“How We Roll.” In the caption, she used lyrics from the song to share the exciting news. “You look at me like that again, we make another kid,” she wrote. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Russell</a> also shared the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> and wrote that he directed it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KimKuZXafCtL%2FEpaNmr5mhwLC6jKSgnatdan51g5Vqamg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fciara-russell-wilson-kids-5147613.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrity-couples-who-starred-in-hallmark-channel-movies-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrity-couples-who-starred-in-hallmark-channel-movies-together.html>Celebrity Couples Who Starred in Hallmark Channel Movies Together</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./swagboyq-19990311-html.html>SwagBoyQ (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./swagboyq-19990311-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
