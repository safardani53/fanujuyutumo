sexual assault of a child nearly three years ago in 2018, when he was 18 and she was 16.</p><p>In the Lone Star State, a child is defined as anyone under 17 years old.</p><p>The second-degree felony is punishable by up to two decades behind bars if he's convicted of assaulting a teenage girl after a party on June 22, 2018 - but Armstrong's lawyer insists it was "a consensual relationship."</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neal Davis Law Firm</a>, a criminal defense attorney's office based in TX, noted that usually the maximum sentence is 20 years while the minimum is two years - but offenses against children receive harsher punishments there.</p><p id=block-f51b5b93-7ada-457f-9211-ba1058679cfd>An affidavit stated that when the girl called Armstrong December 8, 2020 two years after the incident, he admitted to having sex with her&nbsp;at his dad's house and recalled asking her if they were going to have sex.</p><img

id=block-ceb9f953-2b4f-42a4-9fb3-f90c5c60f0bf>“Even if the Romeo and Juliet law applies — even in cases where the relationship is consensual — that doesn’t mean that a rape did not occur in that relationship,” she said.</p><p id=block-f51b5b93-7ada-457f-9211-ba1058679cfd>On November 17, 2020, she told the Austin Police Department how she first met Armstrong (Jr) on June 20, 2018, when she
