<time>14 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>TEEN Mom Kailyn Lowry has been slammed by fans for sounding bitter about her podcast co-host Vee Rivera's luxurious getaway overseas.</p><p>The <a href=#>MTV</a> alum commented on <a href=#>Vee</a>'s vacation to Spain on Friday's installment of her podcast, <a href=# aria-label="Barely Famous (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barely Famous</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/teen-mom-kailyn-lowry-shows-799243533.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/https-www-instagram-com-p-826640447.jpg><p>During the episode, <a href=#>Kailyn</a>, 31, interviewed another member of her inner circle - Alessandra Gonzalez, 31, who also co-hosts with Vee, 32, on her other podcast, Vibin' & Kinda Thrivin'.</p><p>At one point, the ladies discussed the challenges of being an influencer and maintaining quality content for their podcasts and social media platforms.</p><p>Alessandra expressed her insecurities and feelings of imposter syndrome when sharing posts online, prompting Kailyn to share her concerns.</p><p>"I just thought about that this morning. I was like, is my content interesting? Do people still want to follow me? Am I gonna lose my following? Am I posting enough? It's so difficult."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Kailyn Lowry">Read More on Kailyn Lowry</h2><p>The former <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star then measured her success with other content creators, including her Baby Mamas No Drama podcast co-host, Vee, whose trip apparently resulted from her influencer status.</p><p>"And then I compare myself to other creators. Why are they getting these opportunities that I'm not getting. Even the trip that Vee is on. I was like, I'm known for traveling. Why wasn't I offered this?" Kailyn asked.</p><p>Alessandra then explained that the company that funded Vee's trip was explicitly looking for "Latina creators" and someone whose content matched a "similar aesthetic" to their marketing.</p><h2>FAN BACKLASH</h2><p>Vee has been sharing photos and videos on <a href=#>Instagram</a> from her getaway, which she went on with her husband, Jo Rivera.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Some of her posts were shared on the gossip Instagram page Teen Mom Chatter, who commented on Kailyn's remarks in their caption.</p><p>They noted that the reality star sounded bitter toward Vee receiving the opportunity instead of being excited for her friend.</p><p>Others detailed their thoughts in the comments, with some slamming the mom of four's reaction.</p><p>Someone else wrote: "Vee is a Latino so why would they offer this to Kail and not her?"</p><p>Another said: "'I’m known for traveling'… You just don’t expect that from a mom of five. Celebrate your friend’s joy. Hope they are having a great time."</p><p>A third stated: "'I’m known for traveling' girl what??? I can think of seven other things you’re known for, and none of them are traveling."</p><p>And a fourth added: "I couldn’t work with someone like this. I know Vee is getting that [money bag emoji], but I’d rather be broke than have a business with someone who doesn’t build me up and is jealous my success and offers."</p><h2>GROWING FAMILY</h2><p>Kailyn and Vee's relationship stems beyond their business relationship, as they are also connected through family.</p><p>Vee's husband, Jo, is Kailyn's ex and the father of her 13-year-old son, Isaac.</p><p>Kailyn is also a mom to a son, Lincoln, nine, with her ex-husband, Javi Marroquin; and sons, Lux, five; and Creed, two, with her ex, Chris Lopez.</p><p>Additionally, the TV personality is said to have welcomed her fifth child with her boyfriend, <a href=#>Elijah Scott</a>,&nbsp;24, although she has yet to confirm the news.</p><h2>REALITY TV RETURN?</h2><p>It seems Kailyn has been looking for more opportunities to support her blended family, as she recently revealed she's <a href=#>considering returning to reality TV</a>.</p><p>The young mom starred on&nbsp;MTV's 16 & Pregnant and its spin-off series,&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>, for 11 seasons before&nbsp;<a href=#>announcing her departure</a>&nbsp;from the show in April 2022.</p><p>But she might be heading back to the small screen based on her comments on a previous episode of her Coffee Convos podcast.</p><p>During the June 1 episode, Kailyn confessed she was interested in having her own show and even pitched the idea to a network.</p><p>"I had a meeting last week or two weeks ago about doing [a show called] Kail and the Chaos, and I was talking about all of my stipulations, and it was just based on my experience. It wasn't anything crazy," the TV star revealed to her co-host Lindsie Chrisley.</p><p>She then mentioned her demands, which include having a producer credit and seeing the final cut before each episode airs.</p><p>Kailyn further explained why it's hard to distance herself from reality TV completely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I just think it's what I know, so I equate my success to reality TV where I shouldn't because I've worked on things outside of the show that have been super successful for me, this podcast, and things like that.</p><p>"I was on TV for 13 years, so I equate success to having a reality show which is just not fair."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/kailyn-lowry-vetzabe-rivera-aka-817803140.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/kail-confirms-teen-mom-kailyn-825933703-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/inside-kailyn-lowrys-punta-cana-665744892.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZGeCcYSWaKuenZ5iurC5jKSYoqSpo3qtu9arsGaamanBpr6Mr5yeZaKew6a%2BwGaqqZmZo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteen-mom-kailyn-lowry-bitter-vee-rivera-spain.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./families-of-the-mafia-meet-the-cutolos-from-billy-to-layla-on-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./families-of-the-mafia-meet-the-cutolos-from-billy-to-layla-on-instagram.html>Families of The Mafia: Meet the Cutolos from Billy to Layla on Instagram!
