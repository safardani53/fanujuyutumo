Wallace</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Sam Thompson</h3><p>THERE are unbelievable opportunities for <a href=#>I’m A Celeb</a> winner <a href=#>Sam</a> this year including talk shows and a major TV deal.</p><p>I can see marriage, so we should expect an engagement to girlfriend <a href=#>Zara McDermott</a>.</p><img

see happy go lucky for Sam in 2024 — best of luck to him.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Holly Willoughby</h3><p>JOY and happiness are shown in 2024 for the <a href=#>Dancing On Ice</a> <a href=#>presenter</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Fabulous">Read More on Fabulous</h2><p>Emotionally, she’s finding herself again after a time of anxiety and stress, and March will be an important month for her.</p><p>I’m seeing a doorway and a temporary relocation of around six months to the States that will offer her new opportunities.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Alison Hammond</h3><p>THE new year only promises more popularity for <a href=#>the TV presenter</a>.</p><p>I feel she is looking at other doorways, including her own show, and I think the next 12 months will see her heading to exactly where she wants to be in life.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>I feel a very positive vibration from her for 2024 that is all about success, being happy and landing in the right place.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Maya Jama</h3><p>EVERYTHING I’m looking at for Love Island presenter <a href=#>Maya</a> suggests babies and fertility.</p><p>This is a good year for her to look at <a href=#>pregnancy</a> and to also find herself.</p><p>I feel like she will step fully into her own confidence in 2024.</p><p>She is on a spiritual journey as well.</p><p>She will feel broody and want to nest and there may be pregnancy news late in 2024.</p><p>She has never been as happy as she is now and in the coming year.</p><p>Her career will continue to go from strength to strength.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">The Beckhams</h3><p>THIS coming year will set them up to grow stronger, both <a href=#>as a couple and as a brand</a>.</p><p>The next year feels truthful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/victoria-beckham-david-beckham-attend-867461748-2.jpg><p>There’s a blessing, not a vow renewal, but something that lets the world know how solid they are.</p><p>I feel <a href=#>David</a> has gone through his own stresses and <a href=#>Victoria</a> has backed him but their love isn’t in question next year.</p><p>I see a joint business venture.</p><p>We also see them reaffirm England as their home.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Kate Moss</h3><p>HER year ahead is full of stability and structure.</p><p><a href=#>The model</a> has love around her and her success remains here in England.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kate-moss-attends-cosmoss-anniversary-858372462.jpg><p>She won’t want the limelight as much as she did but a new venture will see her dominate the wellness space.</p><p>I see a book in 2024 and photography as she documents the journey of her life.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Harry Styles</h3><p>WE will see a shift away from singing and into other spaces where he can make a change.</p><p><a href=#>The pop star</a> will shock people with a transition somewhere unexpected but fashion design is definitely among the opportunities that are part of his 2024.</p><p>Harry is British and proud — but he’s not done with America.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Royals by Debbie Frank</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Charles</h3><p><a href=#>KING CHARLES</a> will see a lot more challenges, turmoil and digging up of family dirt, forcing him to take a stand.</p><p>April is the most unstable month and controversy and change is all around at home and abroad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/3e73ed78-51f5-478c-bd74-22940143b3b8.jpg><p>His children and living arrangements (all those palaces) pick bones of contention at the October 2 eclipse.</p><p>The King delays action in December as Mars’s retrograde sends him into retreat mode.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Camilla</h3><p>A LEO full moon on January 25 is <a href=#>Queen Camilla’s</a> time to make a queenly show to the world.</p><p>She’ll make solid initiatives in April which reflect those things she truly cares about rather than spreading herself thin.</p><p>July is a jubilant month where she wins praise for her people skills.</p><p>The eclipse on October 2 unpicks royal harmony and she is forced, by circumstances beyond her control, to slow down for a few months.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">William</h3><p><a href=#>THE Prince of Wales</a> will have a breakthrough year in terms of his popularity which enhances his King-in-waiting qualities.</p><p>William will surprise us all during early summer when Jupiter and Uranus give him the wow factor and we see a new side of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7f9d9794-2ed0-4dd1-a1ae-1b8a3ef6bd0e.jpg><p>The solar eclipse on October 2 heralds important work on a global scale.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Kate</h3><p>THIS is <a href=#>Kate’s</a> year to carve out her royal niche.</p><p>She will combine heart and head into projects with enormous appeal.</p><p>She will do this primarily in spring and autumn, which will be her biggest power points as we see and hear more from her than ever before.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Harry</h3><p><a href=#>PRINCE HARRY</a> is fully capable of launching another rocket at the royals this year when gung-ho Jupiter and whistle-blower Uranus unite on his moon.</p><p>April is the month when family relationships could become even more fractured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-lawyers-prince-harry-december-864253413-1.jpg><p>A relocation is likely, too, as the restless Duke of Sussex wants to be in the thick of things.</p><p>An eclipsed full moon on September 18 is a time to make his peace primarily within himself.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Meghan</h3><p><a href=#>DUCHESS of Sussex Meghan’s</a> drive to put her name up in lights continues in 2024, with a major push coming with the eclipses on March 25 and October 2.</p><p>She is not about to let anyone steal her fire and interestingly, just as William and Kate are hitting the headlines in early October, she chooses the same moment for her own major announcement.</p><p>However much will be put on hold in December as Mars reverses over her Mercury, putting a spanner in her schedule.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Sports by Demian Allan</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Harry Kane</h3><p>THIS is a positive year for <a href=#>the England football captain</a>.</p><p>His sun in Leo is supported by the planet Jupiter, which rules expansion and success overseas.</p><p>This means that Harry finally gets to lift a trophy in 2024.</p><p>However, in the second half of this year, Saturn opposes his Mars which indicates a period of injuries and self-reflection.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Sarina Wiegman</h3><p><a href=#>LIONESS manager Sarina</a> is going to have an unpredictable year since the planet Uranus is forming a conjunction with her moon in Taurus.</p><p>She may step away from her current role.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Tom Daley</h3><p>THIS is a year when <a href=#>the diving champ</a> will have to put limitations on himself.</p><p>He is experiencing a Saturn return, which means his career will take a new direction.</p><p>2024 is about planning for the future, in particular regarding family matters and creating a new vision for his home life.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Katarina Johnson-Thompson</h3><p>RELATIONSHIPS take a serious turn for <a href=#>the Olympic heptathlete</a> when she decides to make stronger commitments that will last.</p><p>Because the emphasis is on Venus, her personality and charisma could be explored more in public.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Rory McIroy</h3><p><a href=#>HIS golf career</a> becomes much more settled.</p><p>In the second half of the year Rory experiences his Jupiter return.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/244ffaf5-14e5-4248-9472-00b5369b4684.jpg><p>This means a new 12-year cycle is starting which could take him in a new and exciting career direction plus a possible full-time move abroad.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Ben Stokes</h3><p>MOST of <a href=#>the cricketer’s</a> energy in 2024 is going towards his personal life.</p><p>His moon is in Pisces and that means the planet of duty Saturn is creating a need for him to take on extra responsibilities in his family and emotional life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zac-goodwin-pa-wire-restrictions-843117843.jpg><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mary Earps</h3><p><a href=#>ENGLAND goalkeeper Mary</a> was born under the sign of Pisces, so the planet Saturn will be adding stability but also a new purpose in her career.</p><p>We can expect her to be in the limelight much more this coming year with an emphasis on communication in football.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Jude Bellingham</h3><p><a href=#>ENGLISH Real Madrid midfielder Jude</a> will have an eventful year when professionally he reaches some dizzy heights as well as professional honours.</p><p>But the month of June could be a period when he suffers from an injury that still causes problems in September.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mark-pain-alamy-live-news-853177764.jpg><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Andy Murray</h3><p><a href=#>TENNIS ace Andy</a> is in for an exciting 2024 when the planet Uranus makes an aspect with his Sun sign.</p><p>This combination could mean that he rebels against himself and the way that he is portrayed in the public eye.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Aries - Mar 21 – Apr 20</h2><p>An epic solar eclipse in Aries on April 8 is a catalyst to launch yourself and your projects with unswerving confidence. Fate and destiny will guide you to the right people at the right time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Taurus - Apr 21 – May 21</h2><p>Your luck is in when Jupiter joins with Uranus in your sign on April 21 for the first time in 84 years, making 2024 one of your best years ever. You are going to re-invent yourself and surprise everyone.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Gemini - May 22 – June 21</h2><p>Circle May 25 as the invitation for lucky charm Jupiter to move into Gemini for the next 12 months. Until then you have your work cut out. After that it’s a breeze as opportunities to enhance your life continue to flow.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Cancer - June 22 – July 22</h2><p>Relationships are flowing more easily after January 21. Save yourself for the big autumn push between September 4 and November 4 as activator and achievement planet Mars powers through Cancer.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Leo - July 23 – Aug 23</h2><p>The Leo full moon on January 25 is your cue to stage a massive turnaround, especially with a significant other. Pluto encourages you to express your Leo passion for life and love more deeply.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Virgo - Aug 24 – Sept 22</h2><p>A special “cazimi” conjunction of the Sun and Venus beams down on you on June 4, triggering a great appreciation for your talents and skills. Take relationships to a new level if your birthday falls before September 12.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Libra - Sept 23 – Oct 23</h2><p>Eclipses in Libra on March 25 and October 2 are times to put yourself first for a change and dance with a new destiny. This new year is for putting yourself on the map to carve out personal and professional success.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Scorpio - Oct 24 – Nov 22</h2><p>Pluto’s rare change of sign from January 21 heralds a powerful new era for Scorpios, which marks an extraordinary re-birth for personal life, home and family. April 21 brings a welcome and unexpected offer.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Sagittarius - Nov 23 – Dec 21</h2><p>The time to go for it is in early June when hot-shot Jupiter reaches alignment with passionate Pluto and your intentions begin to manifest in the real world. In the ­second half of the year, partnerships flourish.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Capricorn - Dec 22 – Jan 20</h2><p>Your New Year takes off on January 11 with the Capricorn new moon followed by your smart decisions on January 27 setting up a cracking 2024. Pluto leaves your sign after 15 years and you’re wiser than ever.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Aquarius - Jan 21 –Feb 18</h2><p>Pluto, the great transformer, powers into Aquarius on January 21 so get ready to ring the changes that produce a new you. Mars being in your sign from mid- February to March 22 is your call to action.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Pisces - Feb 19 – Mar 20</h2><p>Saturn and Neptune spend the year in your sign clearing what’s not meant to be and offering miracle solutions. Especially around the Pisces lunar eclipse of September 18, when dreaming big comes up trumps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuaWlsYWiBcLnAsphmopGirm680aKlnJ1dna6zvthmpJqqqWKyor7PrGShp6KkwKS7z56qZqiimrGqr9OipqerXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaya-jama-prince-harry-mary-earps-horoscopes-predictions.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shay-mitchell-felt-pressured-to-snap-back-after-giving-birth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shay-mitchell-felt-pressured-to-snap-back-after-giving-birth.html>Shay Mitchell Felt Pressured to Snap Back After Giving Birth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michele-decesare.html>Fame | Michele DeCesare net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michele-decesare.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
