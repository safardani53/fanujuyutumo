He was spotted partying in low-end Sunset Strip until the early hours as he took time out from promoting The Lego Movie 2.</p><p>A source said: “Chris was hell-bent on celebrating last month’s engagement as soon as he touched down in the UK for his promotional tour.</p><p>“After he finished filming for The <a href=#>Gragham Norton Show</a> he headed to the Sunset Strip club on Dean Street at 10.30pm.

Throughout his stay, Chris didn’t hold back and ordered several bottles of bourbon and champagne.”</p><p>Chris split from his first wife, actress <a href=#>Anna Faris</a> — who is mum to his son Jack, six — in August 2017.</p><p>He popped the question to self-help author <a href=#>Katherine</a> — pictured with him over a more sedate glass of bubbly last year — three weeks ago.</p><p>Somehow I doubt the strippers he met will get an invite to the wedding.</p><h2>READ ON FOR MORE OF SIMON BOYLE'S BIZARRE COLUMN</h2><h2>A tight race for No1</h2><p>IT’S never looked tighter in the race for this week’s chart-topping album.</p><p>The Specials, Busted and Ian Brown are all in the running, with just 700 copies separating them. And landing the coveted top-spot means a lot to them all, as this will be the first time any of them have had a No1 album.

Watch out Vogue...</p><p>DIRECTOR Joe Berlinger has defended his new movie – Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile – about Ted Bundy, after it was accused of glorifying the serial killer. He said: “The idea of ‘making a movie about Bundy equals glorification of him’ is a very naive and knee-jerk reaction.” The murderer is being played by Zac Efron and it is set to be released this year.</p><p>FOALS will headline the Sunday night of Cornwall’s Boardmasters Festival, running from August 7 to 11. Yannis Philippakis and Co join the already announced Florence + The Machine. Mabel, Sam Fender, Martin Solveig, Jax Jones, Razorlight and Plan B.

She wrote: “So far 21 savage memes have been my favorite part of the Super Bowl,” only to be criticised by followers. She later posted on Instagram: “Sorry if I offended anyone, but it’s no excuse to laugh at someone’s addiction, let alone overdose.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhwY2p%2FdoSXaJqhqpmoerG%2BwK2rZp2enK6oscyepa1loJa%2FtcWMrKuroaBisK3BwWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-pratt-engagement-party-strip-club.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./disney-princess-get-a-make-under-see-them-with-no-makeup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./disney-princess-get-a-make-under-see-them-with-no-makeup.html>Disney Princess Get a Make-Under; See Them With No Makeup!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ajee-wilson.html>Ajee Wilson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ajee-wilson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
