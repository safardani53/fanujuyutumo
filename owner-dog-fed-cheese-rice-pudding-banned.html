When I hid the dog food she would give them rice pudding and cheese.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460453101-e1546951840293.jpg><p>"I tried to stop her but it was impossible with her Alzheimer's.

My benefits were stopped and I had no money to take Lucy to the vets.</p><p>"My dogs are my children. I miss them like crazy and I just want them back. I've got no one else."</p><p>Harrison was found guilty of two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to his pets by not providing them with a healthy diet under the Animal Welfare Act (2006).</p><p>He was also found guilty of one count of failing to provide veterinary care for a severe ear disease under the same act.</p><p>Magistrates said Harrison had failed in his responsibility to prevent his dogs becoming 'severely overweight'.</p><p>Chairman Colin Westom said: "As the owner of these two dogs they were your responsibility to care for them and that included their weight.</p><p>"We accept the situation with your mother having dementia was very difficult and you couldn't watch her 24 hours a day but the fact remains these dogs remained severely overweight despite several warnings from the RSPCA and the advice they gave you about managing this.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>"You frequently missed vets appointments over a long period and the ear remained unchecked when it was a significant disease that would have been clearly visible.</p><p>"Your two dogs will not be returned to you as you have a long history of failing to care appropriately for them."</p><p>Harrison was also fined £150, given a £30 victim surcharge and ordered to pay £100 in costs.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
