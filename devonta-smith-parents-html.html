His parents, especially his mother, had a significant impact on him and how he is today.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>DeVonta Smith’s Mom’s Difficult Job Made Him Mature</h2><p>Smith grew up in Southeastern Lousiana with his mother, Christine Smith-Sylve, and little brother, Christian. His mom was a single woman raising her kids through social work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her job was taking children out of troubling situations. She would have to get up and go to work in the middle of the night during emergencies.</p><p>Working for&nbsp;Amite Department of Children and Family Services, her job would take her to dangerous places and situations. And she didn't always have someone with her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Smith did not like her mother's predicament. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>A young DeVonta Smith with one of his parents, mom Christine Smith-Sylve.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: DeVonta Smith/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He even offered to go along with her on multiple occasions and heard unsavory things said to her on duty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I think it made me a better son," said Smith of his mother's situation growing up to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.</p><p>He would avoid doing anything to create a situation like the ones she had to face at work.</p><p>These experiences made him mature at a young age, something everyone noticed. Her mother agrees on the same. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I think it did," said Christine of her son's growth. She used to teach him about how they had little but more than a lot of people.</p><p>We don't live the luxury lifestyle, but what we did have, I worked hard for, and we took care of it, and we never went without.</p><p>She tried to show him the bad condition of the children she rescued to make him understand their position. Smith understood.</p><p>His father, too, had an impact on his demeanor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Smith's&nbsp;mom and his dad, Kelvin Dickerson, split when he was young. However, this did not mean Kelvin wasn't involved.</p><p>A car-detailing business manager, Kelvin, would see Smith on the weekends. "We have a great co-parenting relationship," Christine said of Kelvin.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Smith got his quiet, reserved nature and hard-working tendencies from his dad.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Despite going their own ways, they would always be there, together, for their son, whether that be at football or life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His family dynamic was strong, making for an excellent environment for Smith to grow up in.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>DeVonta Smith Repaid Parents’ Hard Work</h2><p>The values Smith's parents instilled in him have&nbsp;a lot to do with his position now. And his success is one of his gifts to them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The hard work started seeing results even before he reached the NFL.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>For his performances during his senior year for the University of&nbsp;Alabama's Crimson Tide in 2020, he received the Heisman Trophy, an award given to the most outstanding player in college football for the year.</p><p>He became the first wide receiver to win the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">award since 1991</a> and just the fourth overall.</p><p>After being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2021, he scored his first career touchdown on his first catch ever in the NFL. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Under a massive rookie contract of $20.1 million for four years, he used some of that to make one of his parents' life a little better.</p><p>On June 24, 2021, Smith took to his Instagram to reveal that he had bought his mother a house.</p><p>"To the world you are a mother, but to me you are the absolute world," he wrote in the caption as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the video</a> showcased the house and his mother getting emotional because of the gesture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyVq7yvwMBmqqahpJ16sa3RnqWtq16dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdevonta-smith-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelli-giddish-final-episode-law-and-order-svu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelli-giddish-final-episode-law-and-order-svu.html>Kelli Giddish Makes Final Appearance as Detective Amanda Rollins</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html>Bryce Hall Exposes Tayler Holders Sexual Assault Allegations in BFFs Live Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bryce-hall-exposed-tayler-holder-allegations-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
