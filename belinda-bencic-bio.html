Early Life & Family</h2><p>Belinda Bencic was born to her parents, Ivan Bencic and Dana Bencic, on March 10, 1997, in Flawil, Switzerland.</p><p>Her father was a professional hockey player back in the day, while Bencic’s mother was a regular housewife. Her parents are of Slovakian descent and migrated to Switzerland long ago.</p><p>Along with her parents, Belinda grew up with her brother, Brian Bencic, who also plays tennis professionally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Belinda-During-Her-Childhood.jpg><p>All in all, everyone in the family is or has been involved in sports except the big dog of the house, Dana.</p><p>During her childhood, another Slovak Swiss player, Martina Hingis, was one of the best players. Thus, young Belinda fell in love with her and wanted to be just like her idol, Hingis.</p><p>The Swiss player started playing tennis at the age of 2. By the time she was seven, Bencic was training with her idol, Martina’s mother and coach, Melanie Molitor, daily.</p><p>As a result, by the time Belinda was 16, she had already won two junior Grand Slams at Wimbledon and the French Open. Additionally, she was also the no.1 ranked junior player at that time.</p><h2>Belinda Bencic | Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Belinda was born in 1997 and is 26 years old. The Flawil native was born on the 10th of March, making her birth sign Pisces.</p><p>People who fall under Pisces are typically generous, positive, and creative, which are outstanding traits to have.</p><p>Moving on, Bencic stands at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) and weighs around 69 kg (152 pounds).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Star-Tennis-Player-Belinda.jpg><p>Like many other sports, height plays a significant role in tennis as you can serve much more quickly and reach farther.</p><p>Being an athlete, Benic takes good care of her body and does several workouts to maintain her physique.</p><p>Regarding her nationality, Belinda was born in Flawii, Switzerland, making Belinda a Swiss citizen.</p><h2>Belinda Bencic | Professional Career</h2><p>Belinda started her professional career at the age of 14, which is quite mind-boggling because, at her age, most of us were still in high school.</p><p>Returning to the subject, Bencic made her debut at the ITF Women’s Circuit in March 2011, shortly after her 14th birthday.</p><p>After that, she played in low-category tournaments for several years before making her Grand Slam debut at the 2014 Australian Open. But, sadly, she bowed out in the second round to the eventual champion, Li Na.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bencic-At-The-2016-Australian-Open.webp><p>Another significant moment of her career came when she entered the top 100 of the WTA rankings for the first time in her career.</p><p>To explain, Belinda reached the semifinal of the Charleston Open, where she defeated four players in the top 100 rankings.</p><p>She also won the WTA Newcomer of the Year award. Since then, the Swiss player has steadily risen to the top of the women’s game.</p><p>In fact, Bencic reached the no.4 spot, also her highest to date, in the WTA rankings in February 2020.</p><p>Although Belinda has not won any Grand Slam titles, she has now won six singles and two doubles.</p><p>Furthermore, the 5-foot-9 tennis star reached the semi-finals of the US Open in 2019, which is her best result at a Grand Slam event where she defeated then No.1 <a href=# rel=noopener>Osaka</a> for the third time that season.</p><h3>2020 – Present</h3><p>Bencic showed brilliant performance at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics defeating Jessica Pegula, Misaki Doi, French Open champion <a href=# rel=noopener>Barbora Krejčíková</a>, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, <a href=# rel=noopener>Elena Rybakina</a>, and Markéta Vondroušová in the final becoming the first Swiss women to win the gold medal in singles. She also bagged a silver in the women’s doubles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In February 2021, Bencic reached the final of the WTA 500 Adelaide International event. She also reached the quarterfinals of the 2021 US Open, defeating Arantxa Rus, Martina Trevisan, Jessica Pegula, and Iga Świątek before losing to eventual champion Emma Raducanu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Belinda-At-The-2021-US-Open.jpg><p>The Swiss tennis star recorded her first-ever WTA title on clay after defeating fourth seed Ons Jabeur.</p><p>Thus, considering all things, we believe that Bencic will eventually win not only one but multiple Grand Slams.</p><p>We also see her as a future no.1 who will dominate women’s tennis for a long time, like her countryman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Federer</a>.</p><h3>Belinda Bencic | Ranking</h3><p>As of this writing, Belinda is ranked 12th in the WTA rankings.
