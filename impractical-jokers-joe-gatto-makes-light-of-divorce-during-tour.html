He never stopped smiling.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Impractical Jokers</a> alum, 45, who announced on New Year’s Eve that <a href=#>he was leaving the TruTV series after 10 years</a>, “didn’t seem nervous at all,” the source added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Joe-Gatto-Jokes-Life-Pretty-F-king-Fantastic-Tour-Amid-Divorce-002.jpg><p>Joe took the stage at Rhythm City Casino Resort Event Center in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday, January 13. The tour stop came just weeks after the comedian also confirmed on December 31 that <a href=#>he and his wife of eight years decided to part ways</a>.</p><p>During the show, Joe didn’t get into detail about <a href=#>his Impractical Jokers departure</a> or his split, according to the eyewitness, but he did joke about his current situation after a fan asked, “How’s life going?” mid-performance.</p><p>“He was like, ‘Pretty f–king fantastic,’” the insider recalled, noting it was “one of the better jokes” and one of very few that appeared to address his marital status. “He didn’t really get into his personal life,” the source added. “He made a couple jokes about it, and he moved on to the next. He never stayed on one topic for too long.”</p><p>The 45-minute set was mainly focused on his dogs. Joe and Bessy, 39, share 17 pups, many of which they foster.</p><p>“One of the questions was like, ‘[Name] your favorite dog versus your favorite kid,’ and that’s as much he talked about his kids,” the eyewitness told Us, explaining that Joe had a “good attitude” about his personal circumstances throughout the show.</p><p>Earlier this week, the former Tenderloins troupe member, who shares <a href=#>daughter Milana, 6, and son Remington, 4</a>, with Bessy, announced his comedy tour <a href=#>in the wake of his split</a>.</p><p>“When I <a href=#>committed to my upcoming series of shows</a> starting in the Midwest this week, I obviously had no idea what life would look like at this moment,” Joe captioned an Instagram post on Monday, January 10. “Regardless, we can all use some laughter and kindness right now, and I’ll therefore be keeping all of my dates.”</p><p>He noted that he was “excited to share some laughs” with his fans during the upcoming tour, which will run from January to May.</p><p>The following day, <a href=#>Joe stepped out for the first time</a> since his reveal that he was stepping back from the show he created with longtime friends, <a href=#><strong>James “Murr” Murray</strong>, <strong>Brian “Q” Quinn</strong> and <strong>Sal Vulcano</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Joe was photographed heading to the airport on Tuesday, January 11. The same day, Bessy was seen without her wedding ring while at a gas station in Long Beach, New York.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipaCnrqTAyJyYpWWapLimvtJmoaidXZyutcDOZqSao5Woeq21xqGrZqeWYrGqws6rmp5llKq%2FqrrGZquoraJk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fimpractical-jokers-joe-gatto-makes-light-of-divorce-during-tour.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jimmy-carter-begins-hospice-care-after-multiple-hospital-stays.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jimmy-carter-begins-hospice-care-after-multiple-hospital-stays.html>Jimmy Carter Begins Hospice Care After Multiple Hospital Stays</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tao-celebrates-park-city-return-jason-momoa-attends.html>TAO Celebrates Park City Return: Jason Momoa Attends</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tao-celebrates-park-city-return-jason-momoa-attends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
