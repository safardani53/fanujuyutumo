And I was born to rain clouds, blessed in her shadows.”</p><p>She added: “Everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow. And I always believed that, and that's so hard for me to overcome."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000607516824.jpg><p>A talented musician in her own right, Noah hated the spotlight Miley’s career brought to the family.</p><p>In an interview with The Telegraph in March, Noah recalled seeing paparazzi shots of herself for the first time, saying: "It was so stressful seeing pictures of myself online, of reading stuff about myself on the Internet that I simply assumed must be true."</p><p>But in 2016, at the age of 16, Noah came of age by signing a record deal and releasing her first single, Make Me (Cry), with Labrinth.</p><p>She followed it up with collaborations with tragic rapper XXXXTentacion and Lil Xan - who she also dated for six months in 2018.</p><p>She has most recently been linked to rapper Machine Gun Kelly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

year, after releasing the EP The End of Everything, Noah has been taking a leaf out of Miley’s Wrecking Ball book, and ramping up the raunchy.</p><p>Her Instagram is peppered with snaps in skimpy bikinis - and one where she is naked in her garden - and her risque look on last week’s awards clinched the deal.</p><p>But the EP also deals with her mental health struggles and she has openly talked about her anxiety and depression on her podcast In My Feels with Lou Al-Chamaa.</p><p>"I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 10 or 11 years old," Noah told James Corden on The Late Late Show last year.</p><p>"One of the things that I've always wanted is to use this platform to talk about my mental health and help young adults all around America and everywhere in the world know that they're not alone."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

thrust the family into the limelight - and like her siblings, she’s a gifted guitarist.</p><p>She made up one half of pop duo Frank and Derol, formed in 2009, but chart success eluded them - and she once referred to herself as the “forgotten Cyrus sister.”</p><p>But in 2013, Brandi landed a job with Spin Media, covering red carpet events including the American Music Awards - where she interviewed Miley before her performance of Wrecking Ball at the show.</p><p>“I got to talk to a lot of amazing people tonight BUT I had the MOST fun chatting with my little sister!" she tweeted after the show.</p><p>She has worked on similar events for Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood and, in 2017, landed her own interior design show, Cyrus vs. Cyrus, with mum Tish.</p><p>A devoted horserider, Brandi now describes herself as "songwriter, musician, blogger, designer and competitive equestrian."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

boyfriend, who she has identified only as Ry, and posts many a loved-up selfie alongside her glamorous bikini pics.</p><p>The couple spent seven months apart during lockdown and were reunited last month, when he flew over to join her on the Nashville farm.</p><p>Brandi also likes to keep fans up to date with the couple’s travels, recently posting pictures from Italy, Greece, Montana, Iceland and the Costa D’Este Resort and Spa in Florida.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img
