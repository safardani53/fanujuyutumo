The first abduction occurred in 1974 when Jan was just 12 years old, and the second in 1976, when she was 14.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Detailing her story in the 2017 Netflix documentary Abducted in Plain Sight, and in the 2022 Peacock documentary <a href=#>A Friend of the Family: True Evil</a>, Jan hopes her harrowing story can help other victims of grooming and child abuse.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Jan opened up about her life today, including the message she wants people to take away from hearing her story, and how she is actively involved in helping other victims of sexual abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Jan Broberg?</h2><p>With his "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">effervescent" and "wonderful</a>" personality, Berchtold slithered his way into the Brobergs' lives, his sadistic eyes set on Jan the entire time. Via fierce manipulation and grooming tactics, Berchtold — who had a wife and kids of his own — managed to seduce both Mary Ann and Bob, convincing them that he needed to sleep beside Jan in her bed for "therapeutic reasons," and increasingly spending alone time with Jan, separating her from her family in the process.</p><p>Whether it was whisking Jan away to Mexico and attempting to marry her (it was legal to marry a 12-year-old in Mexico in the '70s), or brainwashing her to believe she was part of a grand mission to save an alien race by birthing his child before she turned 16, Berchtold's hellish deeds are both unforgettable and unforgivable.</p><p>Not only did he kidnap her twice, but Berchtold drugged, molested, and raped Jan as part of his disgusting scheme. He made Jan believe that if she refused to complete the mission, one of her sisters would have to step up to the plate, or members of her family would die.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jan — who served as an executive producer on A Friend of the Family — wants audiences to understand that all "people can be groomed," and perpetrators build trust with "other people before they get to the victim."</p><p>"But people weren't getting that — they were blaming my parents; they were blaming the legal system," she added.
