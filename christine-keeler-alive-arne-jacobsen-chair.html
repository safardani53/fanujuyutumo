She had affairs with them both.</p><p>When the love triangle came to light two years later, fears of a Cold War security leak sparked a lurid scandal that rocked the government and had the public transfixed for months.</p><p>It made Christine Keeler one of the most famous women in the world in 1963.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000001005796.jpg><h2>When did Christine Keeler die?</h2><p>On December 6, it was announced that Keeler had died the previous night after battling against the lung disease COPD for several months.</p><p>Her son, Seymour Platt, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>:&nbsp;"My mother passed away last night at about 11.30pm."</p><p>Platt said she was at the Princess Royal university hospital in Farnborough at the time of her death.</p><h2>When did Christine Keeler meet John Profumo?</h2><p>John Profumo, then 46, was Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan's government when he met 19-year-old Christine.</p><p>His first sight of her was when she climbed naked out of the swimming pool during at a party at Lord Astor's country house <a href=#>Cliveden</a>.</p><p>They began an affair that lasted from a few weeks to several months, according to various accounts.</p><p>At the same time, Christine was sleeping with diplomat Yevgeny Ivanov, <a href=#>an intelligence officer</a> and the Soviet Union's naval attache in London.</p><p>Some accounts claim MI5 hoped to use Keeler as a "honey trap" to persuade Ivanov to defect, and were alarmed when they found out she was also seeing Profumo.</p><p>They warned the minister off being associated with Ward's seedy circle, and he ended the affair.</p><p>It remained hidden from the public until 1963 when her disintegrating love life thrust her into the spotlight.</p><p>A jealous boyfriend, Lucky Gordon, fired bullets at Ward's front door as she hid inside, and the subsequent Old Bailey trial caused rumours to swirl in Westminster.</p><p>Profumo lied to the House of Commons, denying any impropriety with Keeler, but was later forced to quit in disgrace, followed months later by the prime minister.</p><p>Ward was put on trial for living off immoral earnings - accused of pimping Keeler, <a href=#>Mandy Rice-Davies</a> and other girls. He killed himself on the eve of the guilty verdicts.</p><p>Keeler, who always denied she was a prostitute, was jailed for nine months for perjuring herself during Gordon's shooting trial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000361425034.jpg><h2>What is the famous Arne Jacobsen chair photo?</h2><p>At the height of the scandal, Christine Keeler sold her story to newspapers around the world and was the subject of a proposed film, the Keeler Affair, which was never released in the UK.</p><p>To promote it, she agreed to pose naked for photographer Lewis Morley in a studio in Peter Cook's Establishment Club.</p><p>Her modesty was covered by the curved back of a bent plywood chair - a copy of the iconic Model 3107 by Danish designer Arne Jacobsen.</p><p>Sales of the Jacobsen chairs surged off the back of the photo, which was reproduced around the world, and many retailers rushed out knock-off designs to cash in on its popularity.</p><p>David Frost and Dame Edna Everidge are among the famous people who have been photographed sitting astride the same chair, which is now an exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000059163834.jpg><h2>What happened to Christine Keeler after?</h2><p>Christine had two brief marriages and two children but mostly lived alone after the scandal.</p><p>Before her death at the age of 75 she was reported to be living in sheltered housing in South London.</p><p>She claimed most of the money she made from newspaper stories was spent on lawyers in the 1970s.</p><p>Christine wrote a number of books about her role in the scandal.</p><p>In an interview to publicise her most recent memoir in 2012, she said she was estranged from her two children.</p><p>She said: "My children don’t want to be associated with that bloody whore Christine Keeler. It’s awful but that’s the way it is."</p><p>She was played by Joanne Whalley in Scandal, the 1989 film about the Profumo Affair.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Profumo Affair: Archive footage of Mandy Rice-Davies</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaYRzhJhqcGibmKe2tMDIp5xmo5Wauaa%2BjJqjoq6VYq6zusRmoZqbn5fAprqMnJ%2BaoaJk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristine-keeler-alive-arne-jacobsen-chair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-hazal-kaya-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-hazal-kaya-dating.html>Who is Hazal Kaya Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-sandoval-sends-love-to-friend-raquel-leviss-on-her-birthday.html>Tom Sandoval Sends Love to Friend Raquel Leviss on Her Birthday</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-sandoval-sends-love-to-friend-raquel-leviss-on-her-birthday.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
