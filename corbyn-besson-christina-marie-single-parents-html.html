<time>09 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Musician&nbsp;Corbyn Besson and&nbsp;Christina Harris,&nbsp;a YouTuber known as "BeautyChickee," who were in a relationship for a long time, have broken up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To confirm the split, they even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recorded</a> a video together and posted it on their social media in January 2021. The video is now available to watch on a fangirl YouTube and Instagram handle.</p><p>In the 38-second&nbsp;video,&nbsp;Harris addressed the&nbsp;rumors of their separation that were going around by stating that the rumors were true.&nbsp;</p><p>"...wanted to come here quicky and just address the rumors that yes we did break up,"&nbsp;Harris said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also revealed that she and&nbsp;Besson had separated "towards the beginning of the quarantine." And both of them did not mention that news with their fans because they wanted some time for themselves to heal.</p><p>...we didn't mention anything about it because we just wanted some time like for ourselves and just time to heal.</p><p>The talented&nbsp;singer-songwriter also agreed with what his ex-girlfriend had to say about their break-up. Doing that, he also stated that the two were on good terms and that they were still friends.</p><p>Besson stated, "Before there's any like extra drama and speculation...uh...we're on good terms, we're friends." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although the video confirmed that Besson and&nbsp;Harris had actually separated, fans were saddened to know the truth.</p><p>"tbh i’ve never been this sad over a social media couple breaking up, but i’m super glad that they’re both on really good terms," a fan commented on YouTube.</p><p>Another wrote in disbelief, saying, "Wait, it’s real?!?!?? I don’t believe in love."</p><p>Besson and&nbsp;Harris's fans had such an emotion attached to the former couple because they were together for very long and seemed perfect together.</p><p></p><p><strong>Corbyn Besson&nbsp;and his ex-girlfriend Christina Marie Harris&nbsp;acting silly together in a picture before the breakup.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Christina's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The former couple hadn't&nbsp;mentioned where and when&nbsp;they first met each other, but they had disclosed that they started dating in 2016.</p><p>More importantly,&nbsp;Harris was&nbsp;Besson's first girlfriend, too.</p><p>Many even wanted them to get married and maintain a family life - but it seems a tough ask now. As of now,&nbsp;Besson seems to be enjoying his single life and focuses on his career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Besson’s Bio Reveals His Parents, Age, Height, and Net Worth</h2><p>The pop singer-songwriter Besson was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on November 25, 1998, in Texas, the United States.&nbsp;His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">height</a> is exactly&nbsp;5 feet and 10 inches.</p><p>He is the eldest of the three children born to his parents.&nbsp;He was raised in Virginia alongside his two siblings&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jordan</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ashley</a>.</p><p>His father's name is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ray Besson</a>, a Senior Program Manager at Amazon Logistics Technology Integration. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Corbyn Besson revealed the identity of his parents (father & mother) through his Instagram.</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Corbyn Besson's Instagram)&nbsp;</p><p>On Besson's 12th birthday, he received a guitar as a gift from his parents which later on helped him build a&nbsp;passion for singing, songwriting, and creating music. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Slowly, his creative skills on music boosted his confidence, and he started&nbsp;uploading his music on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Besson is&nbsp;one of the members of the boyband “Why Don’t We.” Most of the fortunes come in his life from his&nbsp;music career and endorsement deals.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, he possesses a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $2 million to date.
