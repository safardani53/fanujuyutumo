B. McCrea, Royal Artillery.</p><p>And it is rumoured that poet laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson, who moved to Farringford House in Freshwater in 1853, was inspired by hearing guns test firing at the fort when he wrote his most famous poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283862617-e1479747692924.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283862605-e1479747843981.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283862376-e1479747893887.jpg><p>This fort was designed with an upper battery facing the sea and a lower battery that covered Freshwater Bay and a total of seven guns.</p><p>The upper battery became instructional for the School of Gunnery at nearby Golden Hill Fort. A gun exploded there in 1901, killing an officer and three men.</p><p>During the First World War it was manned against attacks from German raiding parties before being decommissioned in 1918 and sold by the army in 1928.</p><p>It was converted into a two-storey private residence in 1936 and was used by the owner as a summer retreat. It even had a swimming pool in the fort's water tank.</p><p>The Home Guard kept watch from the fort during the Second World War and it operated as a tea room from 1977 until the 1990s.</p><p>The Grade II listed house is currently divided with a 'Main house', which has a stunning triple-aspect living room and a large open split-level room called the Sea Lounge, and three bedrooms, an 'Upper Flat' which is an adjoining three-bedroom apartment and and a 'Lower Annexe' which has two bedrooms and its own front door.</p><p>It comes with three acres of grounds and includes a separate one-bedroom holiday cottage called Moonfleet, which was originally married quarters for the master gunner.</p><p>Peter White stayed at the fort in 2005 and wrote Moonfleet the opera, based on the novel Moonfleet about smuggling by J Meade Falkner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283861556-e1479748093739.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283861006-e1479749133895.jpg><p>There is also the Caponier - a two-storey 1850s building which served as barracks for 24 men with planning permission to be turned into two flats - and the Casemates, eight arched store rooms around the courtyard.</p><p>A spokesman for the estate agents Biles and Co said: "It's a spectacular coastal house commanding magnificent panoramic sea views and set within a Victorian fort, atop chalk cliffs overlooking Freshwater Bay.</p><p>"The location is truly spectacular and stands at the foot of Tennyson Down, in an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is on the Heritage Coast, at the centre of one of the island's most photographed and painted landscapes.</p><p>"The Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson lived nearby at Farringford and it has been suggested that the gun practice from the Fort helped him when writing his most famous poem – The Charge of the Light Brigade.</p><p>"The main building has evolved from the original Army officers quarters and the current owners have upgraded and restored the accommodation in the Main House and Upper Flat.</p><p>"The property provides a wonderful opportunity for a principal residence or a coastal second home with the other accommodation useable for staff or caretakers or for generating additional letting or holiday letting income."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
