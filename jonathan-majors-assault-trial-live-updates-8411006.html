Her cross-examination, which concluded this afternoon, extended about seven and a half hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marked by well over 50 sustained objections in a line of questioning that the judge has told the defense lacks specificity, at one point hours into surveillance footage, Jabbari told the defense lawyer: “I’m going to be sick.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jabbari will start re-direct with prosecutors in the morning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Manhattan prosecutors have said that after Jabbari concludes testifying, they expect to call about a dozen more witnesses to Majors’s misdemeanor assault trial, which is anticipated to last weeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arriving to the courthouse in a white coat with blue florals over a red dress emblazoned with green and gold patterned florals, white fur cap, metallic gold backpack and matching gold sneakers, Majors’s defense lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, twice made Jabbari cry, with the young woman fleeing through a side door, her sobs audible from behind closed doors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much of the day on cross-examination was spent reviewing video surveillance footage, Jabbari often crying as she saw the clips, and Majors watching intently, sometimes hunched in the direction of the screen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In one instance that reduced Jabbari to tears, Chaudhry had queued up body-worn camera footage from a police officer who found Jabbari back at the apartment she then shared with Majors the day after the alleged attack. The clip was played for Jabbari on a laptop with headphones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jabbari cried while watching the footage, which jurors and the public could not see or hear, covering her eyes with her hands and looking to the ceiling. “I really don’t want to watch this,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, standing and apologizing to the judge, she excused herself for a few minutes. Majors’s mother pursed her lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Returning, Jabbari told the defense lawyer multiple times: “I don’t want to watch the video.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The video was played again: once on the laptop just for her, which Jabbari watched, touching her eyes as tears streamed down her face and then again loudly in court for the jury.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, the body-worn footage was introduced into evidence by the defense and played loudly for the courtroom. The video depicted Jabbari on the floor of the penthouse she had then shared with Majors, covered in a multi-colored checkered blanket the day after the alleged attack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video, she could be heard saying she had been sick “in the sheets which is disgusting.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turned away from the video, Jabbari covered her face. Facing the screen, Majors watched the footage, eyebrows raised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One female juror nodded along with the defense, mumbling and mouthing repeatedly “that’s right,” to Chaudhry’s questions about the body worn camera footage.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2023-12-07t185240019z></span><h2 id=mntl-blogpost__headline_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-blogpost__headline mntl-text-block"></h2><p><strong>Majors’s Accuser Watches Videos of Herself Dancing in Nightclub Within Hours of Alleged Attack</strong></p><p>December 07, 2023 01:52 PM EST</p>Copy The Link To This Blog Post<p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In video surveillance that Majors’s defense team presented to the jury Thursday afternoon, Jabbari is seen walking into Loosie's Nightclub within hours of the alleged attack by Majors in March.

(Jabbari disagreed with the description but said she did see herself taking a drag of a cigarette at another point in the video.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other clips of the footage, Chaudhry claimed Jabbari can be seen hitting her head – which was also allegedly injured in the altercation with Majors – on the DJ roof. (Jabbari disagreed: “I did not.”)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At another moment, Chaudhry said Jabbari bumped into the wall after several drinks at the nightclub. (“I brushed past it,” Jabbari testified.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chaudhry had released some of the nightclub footage to the press ahead of the trial, and, during jury selection several potential jurors had said they had seen the footage and would not be able to deliberate fairly based on what they had seen.

And, months later, Majors filed a cross-complaint against Jabbari – alleging that she had attacked him that March night, not the other way around – leading to her arrest in October for a case that was not prosecuted and has since been sealed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some 30 or 40 reporters with cameras were standing outside the police precinct that day, Jabbari told the jury, placing her once again in the spotlight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s just been a lot of unwanted attention about a very difficult period of my life,” Jabbari said on the stand, noting that as a result she had felt obligated to hash through details with much of her family, over things “I’d rather keep private.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m a very private person,” she said. “It’s been really hard, the show of it all.
