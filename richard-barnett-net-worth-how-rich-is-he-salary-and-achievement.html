<time>26 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Many people are looking for <strong>Richard Barnett’s net worth</strong> information as the Arkansas man comes before Judge Christopher Cooper at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As an American convicted felon, Richard Morris “Bigo” Barnett became well-known for his participation in the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol.</p><p>He displayed boldness during the siege by putting his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. Barnett was found guilty and sentenced to four and a half years in jail for his role in the attack. The punishment highlighted Barnett’s efforts to profit from his crimes, including the selling of personally signed photographs in Pelosi’s office.</p><p>Long-term consequences of the Capitol riot included stress for Capitol personnel, some of whom departed government employment. Barnett testified in his defense at trial and was exposed to a lengthy and sometimes harsh cross-examination. The convicted criminal admitted to feeling awful about placing his feet on the desk and making a vulgar, sexist statement about Pelosi.&nbsp;Assistant US Attorney Alison Prout argued in court that Barnett should be imprisoned until his sentencing since he was tweeting throughout the trial and showed no remorse for his actions on January 6, 2021.</p><h2>Richard Barnett Net Worth in 2023: Earnings</h2><p><strong>Richard Barnett net worth</strong> is not publicly accessible on the internet.&nbsp;Many people are curious in Richar Barnett’s net worth and entire career earnings after he appeared in court for a hearing related the assault on the United States Capitol.&nbsp;Richard Barnett’s net worth has been scrutinized as a result of his involvement in the assault on the US Capitol and subsequent incarceration.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-Barnett-1.jpg alt="Richard Barnett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, information about the capital rioter’s net wealth is difficult to come across in public records. Memphis Fire Services was unable to validate Barnett’s previous claims that he was a retired firefighter, raising concerns about his background and potential earnings in that field.&nbsp;Although Barnett’s counsel described him as a window salesman, little information about his sales career or financial situation is available. Furthermore, Barnett claimed to be a co-founder of the 2A NWA STAND, a group that advocates for the right to keep and bear weapons.</p><p>Barnett’s actions during the Capitol assault and the subsequent legal proceedings might have had a significant financial effect, including court fees, fines, and perhaps income loss.&nbsp;Due to the nature of his allegations, the longer supervised release, and the hefty penalties, the rioter’s financial situation is unknown to the public.&nbsp;Given the circumstances surrounding his criminal actions and sentencing, determining Richard Barnett’s net worth and profits is difficult.</p><h2>Richard Barnett’s Salary and Achievements</h2><p>There are no publicly available papers that reveal <strong>Richard Barnett’s salary</strong>. Although Barnett has claimed multiple positions as a former Memphis firefighter and window salesman, nothing about his work experience or wages has been verified.&nbsp;According to records obtained by TMZ, Richard made the majority of his money after losing his job as a window salesman due to the Capitol Riot by selling classic autos.</p><p>When discussing the Capitol rioter’s accomplishments, it is critical to remember that Barnett’s involvement in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol coincided with his professional successes.&nbsp;Richard was found guilty of multiple charges, including a felony, for his actions during the assault, which included entering restricted areas and posing for photos with his feet on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. The Arkansas citizen has asked for $100 in contributions in exchange for photos showing himself in the office of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with his feet supported up on a desk while under house arrest.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-Barnett-2.jpg alt="Richard Barnett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Richard Barnett was arrested on January 8, 2021 in connection with his role in the assault on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.&nbsp;He was charged with many felonies as a result of his actions during the disturbance. Barnett was found guilty on all charges in January 2023, including making a disturbance and hindering an official inquiry.&nbsp;The Capitol rioter was sentenced to 54 months in prison, a year of supervised release, and a fine on May 24, 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipopuYlr%2BlecGaqaedpKl6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqm71mapopuYYra0eceeZKyZnJa%2FunnAp5tmmZOdtqbCxKacp6xf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichard-barnett-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-salary-and-achievement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tom-lantos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tom-lantos.html>Tom Lantos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rich-stubler.html>Rich Stubler</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rich-stubler.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
