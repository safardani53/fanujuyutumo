We've reached the final round of group matches at the 2022 World Cup.</p><p>Five-time winners Brazil secured their place in the World Cup knockout stages courtesy of wins over Switzerland and Serbia.</p><p>They'll be joined by Portugal, who also booked their spot with a match to spare thanks to a 2-0 victory over Uruguay on Monday.</p><p>So there's only <strong>TWO</strong> places up for grabs between <strong>SIX</strong> nations. Things should get feisty.</p><p><strong>If you already have a bet in mind, you can take advantage of Bet UK's amazing £30 bonus welcome offer.

So it's another question of motivation and squad changes. See France vs Tunisia for more details…</p><p>Tite will make a host of changes given Brazil would likely finish top even if they suffered a shock defeat.</p><p>Cameroon, meanwhile, need to win their clash to keep alive their qualification hopes.</p><p>Should Cameroon win and Serbia beat Switzerland in the other Group G fixture, Cameroon have a slight advantage with a marginally better goal difference.</p><p>Changes to the Brazil XI sounds like a good thing on paper, but there's some serious quality looking to make a BIG impression before the knockout stages.</p><ul><li><strong>Our pick: Brazil to Win Each Half & Brazil to Have Most Corners in Each Half at 13/2.
