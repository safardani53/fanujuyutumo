She went through college with the same mindset.</p><p>She felt she wanted good enough, and this slowly affected her self-image, which eventually turned into an eating disorder.</p><p>The animator started eating little until she developed side effects like the lack of ability to think clearly and make rational decisions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But eventually, she had enough and knew she had to do something about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She started her recovery but alone as she did not tell anyone. But it was easier said than done.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>She felt like a disgrace and did not want anyone to see her, as she could feel their judgment.
