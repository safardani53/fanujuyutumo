<time>08 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>On Monday, the FBI raided the former president’s Mar-a-Lago estate and, according to Trump supporter Scott Perry, confiscated his phone. The congressman claimed to Fox News that FBI officials requested him to give up his phone while he was vacationing with his family.</p><p>“This morning, while traveling with my family, I was contacted by three FBI officers who confiscated my mobile phone. They made no effort to contact my attorney, who would have arranged for them to have access to my phone if that was what they want.”</p><p>Perry said that the action infuriated him and criticized the Department of Justice. Additionally, he said that his phone carries legislative, political, and personal information that is “none of the government’s business”:</p><p>“I am appalled, but not shocked, that the FBI, under the order of Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice, would grab the phone of a sitting member of Congress. My phone contains information regarding my legislative and political activities as well as personal/private conversations with my wife, family, and friends. This is none of the government’s concern.”</p><p>Before the FBI took action, Representative Liz Cheney said that Perry phoned the White House immediately after the January 6 Capitol Riot to get a pardon. The Republican, though, angrily disputed the claim.</p><p>In its May report on the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the House Select Committee accused Scott Perry of being “directly involved with efforts to corrupt the Department of Justice and install Jeffrey Clark as acting Attorney General.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Scott-Perry-1.jpeg alt="Scott Perry" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition, the committee alleged that Perry had previously communicated with the White House on matters pertaining to the ongoing investigation of the Capitol Riot by the House Select Committee.&nbsp;The message also included “allegations that Dominion voting equipment was compromised.” The committee also charged Perry with sending a text message to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows inquiring about the possibility of appointing Jeffrey Clark as attorney general before January 6.</p><h2>All About Scott Perry</h2><p>Scott Perry is an American politician who represents the tenth congressional district of Pennsylvania.
