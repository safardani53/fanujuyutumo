<time>17 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Renowned internet personality <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/brent-rivera/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Brent Rivera</a> and fellow influencer Pierson Wodzynski have been rumored to be dating each other since 2020, a thing that is still claimed by many media outlets. Besides, some have even mentioned them as an official couple.</p><p>But that doesn’t seem to be true if we consider what the rumored duo has said. Rivera and Wodzynski first met while filming&nbsp;Date Takeover, a dating show. In one of the episodes, she took part as a participant.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of the show was that Rivera’s younger sister <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/celebrity/lexi-rivera-dating-boyfriend/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Lexi</a> would pick who would date him, and Wodzynski ultimately won. Later, she was introduced to his friends. At the time, Rivera was seeing Eva Gutowski.</p><p>They eventually developed a close friendship and started to appear in each other’s videos and social media posts.&nbsp;Rivera spent more time with Wodzynski after splitting up with Gutowski, giving supporters the impression that they were dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brent Rivera and Pierson Wodzynski have denied dating each other</h2><p>On December 24, 2022, Rivera shared a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cute TikTok video</a> with Wodzynski&nbsp;using Marshmellow and Anne Marie’s track ‘FRIENDS’ and captioned the post, ‘we’re fwends.’</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>The “friends” trend is an old one involving two friends who are about to kiss each other but decide against it when the song says, “We’re just friends,” revealing they are just pals.</p><p>Similarly, the two hopped on the trend to admit that they might only be friends and that there is no romantic relationship between them. Rivera and Wodzynski were about to kiss, but just when the song went, “We’re just friends,” they didn’t kiss each other and lip-synced the lyrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, Rivera jokingly tried to kiss Wodzynski again, but Wodzynski pushed him, saying no.&nbsp;Fans were shocked when TikTok appeared on their for you page. One of the fans noted, “I don’t believe it.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, several of their fans questioned whether the two were simply friends, as one of the comments read, “You guys are definitely a couple.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-148.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Brent Rivera and Pierson Wodzynski stayed at an underwater hotel in the Maldives. (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Another fan remarked, “They have to be secretly dating.”</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, famous TikTok creator <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/bryce-hall/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryce Hall</a> also <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@okfinepoop/video/7180477753484053806?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7180477753484053806&web_id=7182048456826684930" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reacted</a> to Rivera’s TikTok with Wodzynski. He said, “All this time, I thought you guys were dating.” Hall further added, “Does this mean I can flirt with Pierson,” after a long pause.</p><p>More recently, in late February 2023, Wodzynski appeared in The Good Boys Podcast, where she discussed multiple topics, including if Brieson was real — Brieson is a shipping name made by the fans of Rivera and Wodzynski.</p><p>Before she divulged the details of her and Rivera’s relationship, she <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tiktok.com/@brierson4life_/video/7190213260212227330 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that she is currently single and doesn’t have a boyfriend. She stated, “officially not in a relationship with anyone.” So, the fan query of “Are Pierson and Bryce dating?” goes invalid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Brent-Rivera-rumored-girlfriend-Pierson-Wodzynski.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Brent Rivera with his rumored girlfriend Pierson Wodzynski at Disney World (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Wodzynski then mentioned that she and Rivera thought of dating and tried it for a while but never took any big steps as it was too much. She said, “Brent and I tried it, um, for, like, a second, and then it was just too much. Like, he’s too busy. I’m too busy.”</p><p>The content creator further explained her statement and said that Rivera films a lot of sensitive content for his self-titled YouTube channel, and if she was dating him, it wouldn’t be okay.&nbsp;</p><p>She also gave an example by referring to Rivera’s video where he went on 100 dates in 24 hours and stressed that if she was actually dating him, she would never let that slide. After that, the podcast co-hosts teased Wodzynski by saying she is obsessive.</p><p>In reply, she stated that she isn’t obsessive and further clarified that if she was dating Rivera and he would go on 100 dates and kiss other girls, even though it’s for content, she wasn’t going to let that slide.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Her answer read, “If my boyfriend is kissing other girls, I’m not gonna slide. So, that’s why I’d rather just not date right now. Focus on my own s**t.”</p><p>To conclude, it can be said that Rivera and Wodzynski considered dating but ultimately decided not to be involved in a romantic relationship. For now, they still remain friends and can often be seen hanging out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brent Rivera’s past relationships</h2><p>Rivera and Morgan Justus, a social media star, were romantically involved from June until October 2017. Their brief romance was not well reported; therefore, little is known about it.&nbsp;</p><p>They did share photos of one another on social media, including Instagram. As of 2022, Rivera and she stopped communicating and stopped following one another on social media.</p><p>Gutowski is another girl Rivera has been linked with. Although they had been reported to be dating since 2017, they only started dating in 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>When Gutowski and Rivera worked together to create YouTube videos in 2016, she developed a strong interest in him. He encouraged her by providing her gestures and encouraging words after observing her interest in him. This continued for more than a year.</p><p>In February 2018, the couple confessed that their friendship was suffering as a result of Rivera just wanting to lead Gutowski on. They ultimately decided to go their separate ways, and they both made a YouTube video about it.&nbsp;</p><p>After some time had passed, Rivera posted a YouTube video in late 2018 declaring his desire for his now-former girlfriend to return and his willingness to give their relationship another shot. In 2019, the two rekindled their romance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>According to reports, they dated for a brief while in 2019 while filming challenges for YouTube. To fool people into thinking they were back together, they pretended to date for a day and even got married in November 2019 as a joke.</p><p>After they split up, Gutowski publicly admitted that her relationship with Rivera was complex in 2020. However, they still keep in touch and follow each other on social media.</p><p class=has-small-font-size><strong>Keep reading <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour Buff</a> for more stories like this!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8GrnKesXae2t7HRmmSdmaSeu6h5z6Kcq6ufo3q4u8OzsKerm558</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrent-rivera-dating-pierson-wodzynski.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./naomi-watts-gets-real-about-plastic-surgery-admits-shes-gotten-close-at-times.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./naomi-watts-gets-real-about-plastic-surgery-admits-shes-gotten-close-at-times.html>Naomi Watts Talks Plastic Surgery, Admits She's Been 'Close at Times'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./barbara-walters.html>Barbara Walters Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./barbara-walters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
