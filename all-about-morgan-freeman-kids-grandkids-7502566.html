Over the years, Freeman has been candid about dedicating his early life to acting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not sure fatherhood changed me," Freeman admitted to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Telegraph</a> in 2014. "It took a while for me to become a father. I was busy trying to be an actor, and the two didn't really go together in my youth."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Freeman's first marriage to Jeanette Adair Bradshaw in 1967 resulted in two more children: He adopted Bradshaw's daughter from a previous relationship, Deena, and the couple had another daughter together named Morgana. He also helped raise Deena's daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>E'dena Hines</a>, with his second wife, Myrna Colley-Lee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The acclaimed actor revealed to The Telegraph that he was more "hands-on" with his daughters. However, it was becoming a grandfather where Freeman felt he really shined. "Now I am in my dotage, I am a great grandfather. I have 14 grandchildren," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of Freeman's grandchildren, Morgana's daughter Alexis Freeman, shared a similar sentiment about her grandfather when she accompanied him to the 2016 Chaplin Awards in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He makes you a really humble person," she told PEOPLE. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>He makes you realize</a> that you have to work for what you want.

Freeman was not present during Alfonso's childhood; the actor left Adkins once he discovered she was pregnant, as Freeman told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Esquire</a> in 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his childhood, he didn't know his connection to Freeman. "I grew up watching The Electric Company and Easy Reader," Alfonso told USA Today in 2007, referencing one of the actor's early roles. "I had no idea that was my dad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The father and son began corresponding when Alfonso was 19; they met two years later when Freeman surprised his eldest child by knocking on his door.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I opened it, and there's Morgan Freeman," he told the outlet about their initial meeting. "At first, you get all those emotions. The anger, the wondering why he wasn't there. But then all you can do is hug. I mean, he's my dad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alfonso eventually followed in his father's footsteps and pursued an acting career. He had several minor roles throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, including appearances in films such as The Shawshank Redemption and Se7en — both of which Freeman had starring roles in — and on television shows like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>West Wing</a>, ER and Southland.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alfonso's most famous role came when he appeared opposite his father in 2007's The Bucket List as Roger, Freeman's on-screen son. According to director Rob Reiner, Freeman believed Alfonso "should audition like everyone else and not be given special treatment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alfonso has been married twice: He and his first wife, Cynthia Gafford, were together from 1982 to 1989 and share three sons (Alfonso II, Joshua and Donovan). He married his second wife, Larcenia Letice, in 1994.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saifoulaye-freeman-63></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Saifoulaye Freeman, 63</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Few details have been revealed about Freeman's second child, son Saifoulaye, who was born in 1960 and whose mother's identity isn't known.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was the only one of Freeman's four children who was absent at the 2018 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>, where the actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>brought his family</a> to witness his Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-deena-adair-60></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Deena Adair, 60</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Morgan Freeman and his daughter, Deena Adair, attend the "Landing Up" premiere on June 7, 2017 in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Greg Doherty/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Freeman married his first wife, Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, in 1967, Bradshaw had a daughter from a previous relationship named Deena, who was born four years prior. Freeman eventually adopted Deena despite legislation that made it difficult at the time, according to Esquire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have a stepdaughter, whom I adopted just as soon as I could," Freeman told the outlet.

I don't remember."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As an adult, Deena's career took her to Hollywood — but not to pursue acting like her father. Instead, she worked as an on-set hair and makeup artist, often serving as Freeman's hairstylist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She is credited with working on films, including Amistad, Along Came a Spider, Bruce Almighty, Million Dollar Baby, The Dark Knight and dozens of other titles with her father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Deena was also part of the hairstyling teams nominated for two <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emmy Awards</a> for outstanding hairstyling in a miniseries or movie: for Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story in 2009 and Ring of Fire in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1982, Deena gave birth to a daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>E'dena Hines</a>, who was raised by Freeman and his second wife, Myrna Colley-Lee.

She's been by his side at the premieres of Batman Begins and Oblivion and was also present when Freeman received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2018 SAG Awards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Morgana attended Spelman College in Atlanta, where she majored in economics, according to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LinkedIn</a>. She also studied cosmetology and went on to own two salons in Georgia.

After studying acting at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts from 2008 to 2011, she embarked on a career as an actress, with minor roles in the television series A Minority Report and the short film Cohab. Hines eventually landed her biggest role in the movie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Landing Up</a>, however, tragedy stuck before it was released.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Aug. 16, 2015, Hines was brutally <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stabbed to death</a> more than a dozen times by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Lamar Davenport.
