<time>13 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Caleb Love’s parents, Alecia Thompson and Dennis Love</strong> divorced but remained involved in their child’s childhood. The Wildcats player is the only child of his parents and grew up in St. Louis.</p><p><strong>Caleb Love returned to Durham, but this time with the Arizona Wildcats</strong>. Love spent three seasons at the University of North Carolina before deciding to transfer early this year.</p><p>Love returned wearing shoes with the words “Tar Heel 4L” printed on them. Love led the Wildcats to a 78-73 victory over the Blue Devils alongside teammates Keshad Johnson and Oumar Ballo.</p><p>He finished with 11 points, three rebounds, six turnovers, and four free throws in 17.4 seconds. This was Duke’s first home loss since Love and North Carolina upset them in the regular season last year.</p><h2>Alecia Thompson And Dennis Love: Meet Caleb Love’s Parents</h2><p><strong>Alecia Thompson and Dennis Love, Caleb Love’s parents</strong>, say their son had already paid them back. Love used to have a Twitter banner that said, “My goal is to pay back my parents.”</p><p>And it’s possible that the collegiate athlete removed the bio from his account following that interview. Caleb grew up in a nurturing environment, as evidenced by the encouragement he received from Dennis and Alecia following his freshman season.</p><p>Dennis Love, a former military personnel, claims he never shied away from adversity but instead tackled it head-on. Dennis Love stated in an interview with Carl Reed that when things aren’t going well, it’s best to put your head down and work on your talents.</p><p>Dennis was a member of the high school football team and had to work exceptionally hard to be selected. Dennis grew raised in a home with bickering parents. He didn’t want his child to fall into the same trap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Caleb-Love-Parents1.jpg><p>Dennis coached his son till he graduated from high school. When Caleb had a bad season, Dennis and Alecia didn’t tell him to use the transfer portal, as many parents do.</p><p>Dennis and Alecia both stated that they never ran away from the problem. As a result, they did not want their son to resign. They kept telling Caleb that adversity and competition would bring out the best in him.</p><p>Dennis was correct. Caleb shone in his second year at North Carolina. Dennis may be found on Instagram under the handle @dennis._love, where he frequently posts photos of his famous son.</p><p>According to Dennis and Alecia’s Instagram handles, the pair has been separated for a long time. Dennis has a daughter from a previous relationship, and Alecia is married to Lou.</p><h2>Caleb and his close relationship with his family</h2><p><strong>Caleb Love</strong>, the Wildcats’ standout player, comes from a family with separated parents, but he has a deep bond with both of them. The Arizona Guard published a touching message for his maternal grandfather in 2021. The footballer shared various photos of himself and his Papa, ranging from boyhood to his time in Northern Carolina.</p><p>Caleb looked up to his grandfather as a child. He was his inspiration. He aspired to be like him and described his grandfather as a selfless man. His Papa attempted to attend every game possible, and Alecia has also published multiple tribute pictures to her father on Instagram.</p><p>Caleb’s siblings bond with his little sister, Caylee, according to his father’s Instagram account. Dennis has shared numerous photos of the trio, and Caylee has gone to several of her older brother’s games.</p><p>Caleb Love’s seven-year-old sister has her own Instagram account and describes herself as a style influencer. Caylee recently wore a Wildcats hoodie to support her brother.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpZ2Tnq5uwMeopKmrn6N6orrDZpuepp6ewG64zq%2BcZqWVmsFur8ClnJtlnKTDpnnPmqmepqSofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falecia-thompson-and-dennis-love-meet-caleb-love-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nose-jobs-2009311.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nose-jobs-2009311.html>Did They Have a Nose Job?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./villa-mad-12-year-old-school-boy-called-aston-killed-after-he-was-hit-by-a-bus.html>Villa mad 12-year-old school boy called Aston killed after he was hit by a bus</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./villa-mad-12-year-old-school-boy-called-aston-killed-after-he-was-hit-by-a-bus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
