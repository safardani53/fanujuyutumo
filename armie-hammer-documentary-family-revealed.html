Every generation in my family has been involved in dark misdeeds, and it just gets worse and worse and worse."</p><p>The show also looks into claims from multiple women who read texts they alleged to be from&nbsp;<a href=#>Armie</a>, 35, that depict graphic sexual violence amongst other shocking things.</p><p>His ex Courtney Vucekovich tells the doc: "The ropes were around your neck, your wrists, your ankles, behind your back, I mean, I had bruises, I hated it."</p><h2>'MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD'</h2><p>It will also investigate reports of a suspicious death after Armie's grandfather Julian was accused of killing his best friend before Armand saw that the charges were dropped.</p><p>He was accused of slaying a longtime pal, Bruce Whitlock, 28, during an argument over an old debt.</p><p>Casey added: "The story that he told us was self-defense but my mom was very quick to tell me, ‘No, your father just murdered someone in cold blood.’"</p><p>The doc also links Armand to the payments made to the burglars in the Watergate scandal.</p><p>And when an oil rig owned by Armand’s Occidental Petroleum exploded in 1988 killing more than 160 men there were accusations of a "cover-up" of what really happened.</p><h2>'DYSFUNCTIONAL DYNASTY'</h2><p>Discussing the doc, the Talos Films co-founders shared: "A dysfunctional dynasty with its male characters exhibiting all the devastating consequences of privilege gone wild.</p><p>"Now, for the first time, Casey Hammer will tell not just her story, but the definitive family history, leaving no stone unturned."</p><p>They added: "With new unfolding revelations and present-day consequences, this mini-series will provide audiences with a riveting journey into a family where reputation is everything and where things are never how they appear."</p><h2>SLEW OF ALLEGATIONS</h2><p>Hammer - who saw <a href=#>his career derailed by a slew of sexual allegations </a>- has more recently been spotted <a href=#>hunkered down in the Cayman Islands.</a></p><p>In March last year, it was announced he was being investigated for sexual assault in Los Angeles.</p><p>That came after a former lover, only identified as Effie, claimed he had "mentally, emotionally and sexually" abused her during their four-year relationship.</p><p>In 2017, Effie alleged that she was violently raped when Armie slammed her head against a wall.</p><p>She also alleged that he whipped her feet with a crop, which would hurt for days.</p><p>Armie denied the allegations and his attorney released a statement at the time of the claims: "These assertions about Mr. Hammer are patently untrue.</p><p>"Any interactions with this person, or any partner of his, were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory."</p><h2>INVESTIGATION 'CONTINUES'</h2><p>The District Attorney told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that the case remains under investigation.</p><p>LA County District Attorney’s Office spokesman Greg Risling said: “A specially assigned prosecutor is working with law enforcement as they continue their investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once law enforcement has completed their investigation and submits the case to our office we will conduct an evaluation and file criminal charges that are supported by the evidence.”</p><p>Then, in early March, Armie's ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze, 24, said in an&nbsp;<a href=#>explosive interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;that during their time together she felt “really unsafe and sick to her stomach."</p><p>"He told me that I couldn’t have anyone else in my bed. And then I just started to feel really unsafe and really sick to my stomach about things. I was also emotionally dependent on him," she explained.</p><h2 id=back-in-action>BACK IN ACTION</h2><p>Armie officially split with his wife of 10 years Elizabeth Chambers in 2020, who he shares two children with.</p><p>In December, Armie&nbsp;<a href=#>completed his rehab</a>&nbsp;after six months of treatment following the shocking accusations.</p><p>A source exclusively told The US Sun at the time: "Armie is out of the treatment facility where he spent months.</p><p>"He is doing really well and it's wonderful news for his family.
