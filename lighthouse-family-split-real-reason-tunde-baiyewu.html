It breaks my heart to let you down.”</p><p>But, in his first interview since the news of their bitter split broke, Tunde has now revealed his side of the story, claiming he was left feeling like a "doormat" - with the final straw being when Paul locked him out of all their social media accounts.</p><p>"We're not on talking terms,” Tunde says. “I haven't spoken to him because of that for over two years.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just want to get on with my life and make music, but we haven't spoken for almost two years now.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN SHOWBIZ">READ MORE IN SHOWBIZ</h2><h2>'Final straw'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/photo-tunde-baiyewu-lighthouse-family-738750457.jpg><p>The announcement of Lighthouse Family’s shock split came last year, just before they were due to play their last gig at the Mouth of Tyne Festival on July 9.</p><p>Revealing they were pulling out of the festival, Paul wrote on Instagram: "I’m so sad to let you know that after almost 30 years we have reached the end of our Lighthouse Family journey.</p><p>“Tunde now wants to focus on his solo career and I wish him all the best.</p><p>“I was really looking forward to this hometown show and playing our songs in this amazing place close to the lighthouses that gave us our name.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"I am as disappointed as you are. It breaks my heart to let you down.”</p><p>But Tunde reveals how behind the scenes Paul had locked him out of their social media accounts.</p><p>“He locked everybody out,” Tunde says. “He locked the managers out, and even the record label that was supposed to be looking after the social media portals.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve had no access for over two years. Whenever you see anything posted on the Lighthouse Family Facebook page, I'm not the one doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've been locked out of all of that. I have no say.&nbsp;</p><p>“If somebody says, ‘Happy Birthday, Tunde on the Lighthouse Ffamily social media page, I can't even say thank you, because I've been locked out.”</p><p>If somebody says, ‘Happy Birthday, Tunde on the Lighthouse Family social media page, I can't even say thank you, because I've been locked out</p><span class=quote-credit>Tunde Baiyewu</span><p>What made it worse for Tunde was that he’d actually bought the Lighthouse Family Facebook page off of a fan who’d created it years ago - meaning it technically belonged to him.</p><p>He explains: “When we made this last Lighthouse Family record, the record company come to me and said, 'We know you own it, but can we use it?'</p><p>“So I gave it to everybody to use it and then to find myself locked out of it was just unacceptable.</p><p>“That was the final straw for me. When it gets to that level, you just realise the spirit that started the whole thing is not there anymore, and I just found that it's best to just step away from it and do my own thing.”</p><h2>'Taking a toll'</h2><p>Hailing from <a href=#>Newcastle</a>, the Lighthouse Family's 1995 debut album, Ocean Drive, sold more than 1.5 million copies.</p><p>Best known for their single, High, which went to number one in Australia, the duo first met while working in bars in their hometown.</p><p>They signed to Polydor Records in 1993 and Ocean Drive went on to be six-times certified platinum.</p><p>The group's sophomore album, Postcards From Heaven, achieved similar success.</p><p>Tunde admits their recent split&nbsp; is “very sad, considering when you look at the history of the band”, but notes how it often happens with bands.</p><p>He explains: “Usually it's just because success breeds that kind of thing, where there's always inequality within a band and maybe somebody feels that they're the ones that are supposed to be calling the shots.</p><p>“Slowly what happens is, when that creeps into the situation, it can affect a lot of things and, especially for me, I just felt like I had to step away from it because it was taking a toll on my mental health.”</p><p>Lighthouse Family took a break from touring and promotional appearances in the early 2000s to focus on their solo projects.</p><p>They reformed in 2010 and completed national tours in the UK and Ireland, and they released their fourth and final album in 2019 called, Blue Sky in Your Head.</p><h2>End of the road</h2><p>But Tunde believes this is the end for them now.</p><p>He says: “For my own mental health and mental sanity, I just realised everything has a beginning and an end, it doesn't matter how good it is.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s just part of life.</p><p>“I think you do have to realise when you get to that point, there's no point carrying on and allowing yourself to be a doormat. That's just not acceptable."</p><p>Despite High being released in 1997, Tunde notes how <a href=#>Joey Essex</a> skated to it on <a href=#>Dancing On Ice</a> this series, in <a href=#>honour of his late mum</a>, and he also recently heard it on <a href=#>EastEnders</a>.</p><p>And, for that reason, he will be performing all the Lighthouse Family hits when he heads off on a tour around the UK in May, starting in <a href=#>Cardiff</a> and ending in <a href=#>Manchester</a>.</p><p>He says: “I co-wrote those Lighthouse Family songs. Lifted is my song, High is my song. And those are songs that a lot of people know.</p><p>“People know those songs and they mean a lot to people. They mean a lot to me.&nbsp;</p><p>“Wherever I go, those songs come with me. Those songs are part of my DNA, because we wrote them together.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The Sun has contacted Paul Tucker's representatives for comment.</p><p>Tickets for Tunde’s UK tour available from <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">www.tundeb.com</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tunde-baiyewu-lighthouse-family-802758644.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYWuGdYKWbWaloZedwam71KycZp6RoratxYysp6WhpGK%2Fpq3LZqmemaOku27A1KebnmWSlra6sdauZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flighthouse-family-split-real-reason-tunde-baiyewu.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kevin-wilson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kevin-wilson.html>Kevin Wilson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-driving-experience-days.html>16 Best Driving Experience Days 2022 | The Sun UK</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-driving-experience-days.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
