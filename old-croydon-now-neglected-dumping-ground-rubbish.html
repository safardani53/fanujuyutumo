No one has really looked after it since then, whether it is Labour or Conservative.”</p><p>The town centre's Whitgift Centre opened in 1968 but plans this century to redevelop it into a £1.6bn Westfield mall were ultimately abandoned in 2019.</p><p>David Leadbeater, who has lived nearby since 1996, said: “I think it is important to highlight the history here.</p><p>"It used to be much busier - it is such a shame. It would help if they made it easier for people to park their cars.”</p><p>Fellow resident Gill Ball said: “I don’t think it is nice and I live here - it has gone downhill.</p><p>"I think everywhere in Croydon has potential but we are paying mega council tax and seeing no change.”</p><p>Joyce Dean, who has lived in Croydon since the 1970s, is also among those dismayed by the Old Town's present appearance and plight.</p><p>She said: “There are beautiful buildings and a lot of history of Croydon that people don’t know about - so many Archbishops of <a href=#>Canterbury</a> are buried here.</p><p>"I have watched it go down the tubes. It has everything going for it - it’s got the wonderful <a href=#>train service</a>s to London.</p><p>“I think the council has spent all the money on the wrong things. They have sold the family silver and wasted so much on Fairfield Halls and buying the Croydon Park Hotel for way over the odds was a scandal.”</p><p>The hotel has recently been bought, with plans for redevelopment into <a href=#>flats</a>, by Amro Partners for £24.9m - compared to the £29.8m paid for it by Croydon council in 2018.</p><p>Work to renovate entertainment venue Fairfield Halls - whose <a href=#>1960s</a> and <a href=#>1970s</a> heyday attracted such acts as <a href=#>The Beatles</a>, <a href=#>David Bowie</a>, <a href=#>the Who</a>, <a href=#>Queen</a> and <a href=#>Morecambe and Wise</a> - was finished in 2019, yet at a £70m cost rather than the original £30m budget.</p><p>The 15 per cent council-tax rise announced last month came after special permission from the Government and <a href=#>levelling-up</a> secretary <a href=#>Michael Gove</a>, and followed the local authority being given its third bankruptcy notice in two years.</p><p>A council spokesperson said: “The council is undertaking a major £7.5m project investing in improving the public realm and parks in Minster Green, in Croydon’s Old Town.</p><p>"Detailed designs are being finalised and will be shared with our residents and partners later this year, ahead of construction starting.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Designed in consultation with the diocese and local community, the plans include the relocation of parking, removal of the pedestrian subway, a new play area offering green open space and lighting around the Grade I-listed minster.</p><p>"The new layout and lighting will create a space for residents to enjoy along with tackling issues such as vandalism and antisocial behaviour.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
