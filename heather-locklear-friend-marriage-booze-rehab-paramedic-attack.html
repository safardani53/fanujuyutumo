Hooker in 1982.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also with Aaron that she later got one of her biggest roles, starring in soap Melrose Place from 1993 to 1999.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Heather was one of the world’s first “manufactured” stars, picked up by manager Joan Green in 1979 aged 19 while acting and studying for a psychology degree at the University of California.</p><h2>America’s sweetheart</h2><p>Working with photographer Harry Langdon, she carefully crafted Heather’s sexy but innocent image that catapulted her to stardom.</p><p>In an early interview Joan described Heather as being able to go “from girl <span id=a2892f69-ceca-4fbb-989b-953ff7887fff class=suggested-link>next</span> door to a sex goddess if we’re in the mood”.</p><p>Looking visibly uncomfortable, the actress herself added: “It’s the sex stuff I’m a little bit cautious of.”</p><p>However, Heather was soon gracing the cover of magazines in a variety of sultry poses which helped raise her profile and firmly establish her as America’s sweetheart.</p><p>But her clean-living image took a dent when she started dating Motley Crue drummer Tommy <span id=eeb5616c-b268-4350-b2eb-5dab208f229d class=suggested-link>Lee</span> in 1985, nine years before he ever set eyes on <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a>.</p><p>Aged 23, Tommy had already been married for all of seven days to model Elaine Starchuk, but fell hard for Heather.</p><p>He later said: “I was so shy I couldn’t have possibly gone up to her myself, but it was Heather or bust”.</p><p>After using a pal as a go-between, Lee proposed in the back of a limo three months after their first date, when Heather was 25.</p><p>They married in a star-studded ceremony in 1986, with Lee quoted as saying: “I think we will be the coolest grandma and grandpa in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>"We will be like 85 or 90.&nbsp;I will still be a rock pig and Heather will still be gorgeous.”</p><p>The union lasted seven years, but Heather called it quits after a sex tape showed Tommy with a porn star.</p><p>He later admitted: “Yeah, f***ing with porno stars ruined by marriage.”</p><p>Many&nbsp;people&nbsp;were shocked when a hurt Heather went on to date another rock star, this time Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora.&nbsp;They married in <a href=#>Paris</a> in December 1994.</p><p>Four years later, she said: “He’s really family orientated and very close to his parents.&nbsp;Who I am as a person is really who Richie is as a person.&nbsp;We mirror each other.”</p><p>Similarly smitten Sambora, who had previously been linked to singer Cher, said: “I had a great time dating women. But the minute I met my wife, I knew I was done. That was it.</p><p>"I think the same thing happened to her.” They had daughter Ava in 1997 and two years later Heather landed a plum role on sitcom Spin City with <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a>.</p><p>But in early 2006, Heather blindsided Sambora by announcing they were getting divorced amid his substance abuse problems and rumours he was cheating,&nbsp;which he denied.&nbsp;</p><p>The guitarist had no idea they were splitting up until Heather put out a press release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/heather-locklear-joan-collins-john-829974495.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ava-elizabeth-sambora-attends-33rd-829925177.jpg><p>Just hours earlier he denied divorce rumours, calling them “completely untrue” and insisting he had Valentine’s Day plans with his wife later that month What came next rocked Heather to her foundations.</p><p>She discovered Richie was dating her friend, actress <a href=#>Denise Richards</a>, who had dumped husband Charlie Sheen a year earlier while pregnant with their daughter Lola.</p><p>Heather and Denise had grown close as the latter visited Sheen on the set of Spin City. Richards later denied “stealing” Sambora</p><p>Denise said: “The thing with Heather, that’s been hard.</p><p>“You can’t help who you fall for and that friendship, unfortunately, was done and wasn’t salvageable. People have gone on — Would you date your best friend’s husband?.</p><p>“You know, she wasn’t my best friend. She was a close friend in the past couple of years. I hadn’t known her my whole life.”</p><p>The same year she split from Sambora, Heather was further devastated by the death of her mentor Aaron Spelling.</p><p>They had a close friendship and he called her his “lucky charm” after she helped him boost viewing figures for Melrose Place.</p><h2>‘Super hurtful’</h2><p>A year later, Heather got together with Melrose Place co-star Jack Wagner but things went downhill quickly.&nbsp;In 2018, it is alleged her doctor made a 911 call claiming she was suicidal.</p><p>Three months later she checked into an Arizona medical centre for anxiety and depression.</p><p>Within weeks, cops in California pulled her over on suspicion of driving under the influence.</p><p>Tests revealed she was not on illegal drugs but was taking anxiety medicine that would have “impaired her ability”.</p><p>In January 2009 she was given probation and a fine for reckless driving, but a year later was picked up for a hit-and-run after crashing into a no-parking sign.</p><p>She was ordered to undertake a 30-day rehab programme.</p><p>In 2011, Heather and Jack got engaged but cops were called to break up a fight between the two and they split.</p><p>The following year, Heather’s family admitted she had had issues with alcohol that date back years.</p><p>Heather made attempts to get clean and in 2016 got together with her high school boyfriend Chris Heisser, who she is now engaged to. But she was soon back in rehab once again.</p><p>In 2018 she drove into a ditch and was later arrested for domestic violence.</p><p>The charges were dropped but Heather still faced four counts of mis-demeanours for hitting a cop and an ambulance worker during the incident.</p><p>She was put on probation which lasted until last August.</p><p>Friends claim the recent pictures show Heather having “a bad day”.</p><p>One said: “Heather is most definitely not drinking, she hasn’t for years. She’s very upset at that allegation, it’s super hurtful.”</p><p>There is no doubt Heather is a fighter who might rally from her troubles.</p><p>She once said: “Things change from one day to the next. I’m very lucky.</p><p>“The good that I’ve had so far outweighs the bad. I know that it could go away tomorrow, so I appreciate it.</p><p>“But I keep in mind that if it all goes away tomorrow, I may have another chance.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In May this year, Heather attended the graduation of daughter Ava, 25, who is her spitting image. She was studying a degree in family therapy.</p><p>After her mum’s years of torrid relationships with men, perhaps <a href=#>Ava</a> is hoping she&nbsp;will be the&nbsp;one to finally save her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a9feeb9d-ef2b-4066-a6c9-7bdea8a148fa.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tommy-lee-heather-locklear-4th-388329368.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWmAcYWRaJ%2BemaSdsrN5y6iapKSVlr9ustGinKecXaKus77Imp6eZZKkvLuxjKucoZmSYr2ivsCmnJ2hk2KutcDAnKJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheather-locklear-friend-marriage-booze-rehab-paramedic-attack.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./john-besh-19680514-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./john-besh-19680514-html.html>John Besh (Chef) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./homeless-couple-sleep-middle-road-mattress-south-ockendon-essex.html>Heartbreaking pic shows homeless couple forced to sleep on dirty fly-tipped mattress in the middle o</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./homeless-couple-sleep-middle-road-mattress-south-ockendon-essex.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
