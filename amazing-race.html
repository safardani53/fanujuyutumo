I stopped into his truck stop and we started talking. We both had a lot in common and hit it off right away!<br><strong>Current occupation:</strong> Contract Engineer<br><strong>Describe what you do: </strong>I am a contract engineer who does work for ATT. I also co-own a roller derby league that I started in my small town.<br><strong>3 words to describe you: </strong>Athletic, creative and driven.<br><strong>Favorite hobbies:</strong> Roller derby, paddle boarding and snowboarding.<br><strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Raising an 8-year-old son who is creative, unique and absolutely amazing!<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of yourself?</strong> Joan Jett<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of your teammate?</strong> Opie from “Sons of Anarchy.”<br><strong>What scares you most about traveling?</strong> Getting lost in unfamiliar places.<br><strong>What excites you most about traveling?</strong> Learning new cultures and experiencing things I cannot here in the U.S.<br><strong>Biggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: </strong>He’s not good at expressing things when he’s upset. He keeps it all in until he blows up about whatever is on his mind.<br><strong>Pet peeve about your teammate: </strong>When he’s in public he is in his “Mikey Zeroe” persona which isn’t who I signed up to date. His ego can get in the way.<br><strong>What country and place would you most like to visit and why?</strong> Bali, Indonesia - I heard it’s absolutely stunning and the people are very friendly. I also heard it’s affordable.<br><strong>What do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? </strong>As a single mom, I am very protective on whom I bring into my son and my life. I am looking at the race sort of as a "Fast Forward" to our relationship. I am hoping by going on the race I can figure out if our relationship will last.<br><strong>How could the Race change the current state of your relationship? </strong>Since we haven’t dated all that long, it will be a make or break situation and help me figure out if we are meant to be together. I don't want to waste time with someone who I cannot depend on.</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>Michael Dombrowski<br><strong>Age: </strong>26<br><strong>Hometown: </strong>Traverse City, Mich.<br><strong>Relationship Status:</strong> Dating<br><strong>Length of Relationship: </strong>8 months<br><strong>How did you meet?</strong> Rochelle and I met through both running our events at the same venue. Eventually we set up a cross-promoting partnership and began getting to know each other and I was hooked.<br><strong>Current occupation: </strong>Pro Wrestling Promoter and Truck Stop Manager<br><strong>Describe what you do:</strong> Promote, book and organize professional wrestling events. Keep growing audience event to event.<br><strong>3 words to describe you:</strong> Passionate, extreme and unique.<br><strong>Favorite hobbies:</strong> Hiking, fishing, traveling to concerts and road trips.<br><strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Booking WWE Hall of Famers Mick Foley and Scott “Razor Ramon” Hall in my hometown of Kalkaska, MI. It was front page news here.<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of yourself?</strong> Harley Morenstein of Epic MEAL Empire. Obnoxious at times, similar look and style.<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of your teammate?</strong> Kesha- unique, own style/image, like to have fun.<br><strong>What scares you most about traveling?</strong> If I’m traveling somewhere new to me, the possibility of getting lost or stranded with no resources.<br><strong>What excites you most about traveling?</strong> Getting to see different cultures and ways of life, change of scenery from city to city, and country to country.<br><strong>Biggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: </strong>Rochelle’s listening ability. She says I give good advice, and can coach her through situations, but she doesn’t always listen to my advice.<br><strong>Pet peeve about your teammate:</strong> That she gets legitimately pissed off if I beat her at anything. Even something as small as a game of checkers. I love her competitiveness, but not when I’m her competition.<br><strong>What country and place would you most like to visit and why?</strong> Tokyo, Japan. Many wrestlers I know travel there for events, and I’ve heard nothing but amazing things from them all.<br><strong>What do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? </strong>I hope to gain a stronger connection with Rochelle, to see if we can handle the stress, and work together through it. I also feel it would be a very good bonding experience.<br><strong>How could the Race change the current state of your relationship?</strong> It would without a doubt test us for the future. A worldwide race within a month would test our strength, teamwork and communication skills. If we come out of the race stronger, we should be able to handle anything.<br><a href=#>Watch their cast bio video!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JomKaZqp67qKvRmpqeZ5OWwLV7kWprcnFlZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famazing-race.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ewen-bremner-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ewen-bremner-dating.html>Who is Ewen Bremner Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kenn-whitaker-all-about-the-brother-of-famous-actor-forest-whitaker.html>Kenn Whitaker- All About The Brother Of Famous Actor Forest Whitaker</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kenn-whitaker-all-about-the-brother-of-famous-actor-forest-whitaker.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
